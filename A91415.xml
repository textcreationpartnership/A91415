            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>It is evident to me, that the Jewes-Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue-Aſſemblies were particular Churches of JESUS CHRIST: becauſe it was the Angel of the Covenant, the Son of God, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that did ordain and inſtitute not only all the twelve Tribes into one Nationall-Church, but alſo that did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and diſtribute the ſaid twelve Tribes into ſeveral particular Churches. I ſay, Jeſus Chriſt did inſtitute both theſe kind of Churches in Iſrael<hi>:</hi> he was the Angel-Jehovah, that firſt <hi>ſpake unto Moſes out of the buſh,</hi> Exod. 3. 2. called alſo <hi>the God of Abraham,</hi> verſ. 7. and he is alſo called <hi>the God of Glory, that firſt appeared to Abraham while he was an Idolater in his Fathers houſe in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia,</hi> Acts 7. 2. Joſ. 24.</p>
                  <p>This God of glory did now appear unto <hi>Moſes in the buſh,</hi> and ſent him to bring his People <hi>out of Egypt, and out of the houſe of bondage,</hi> Exod. 20. therefore Chriſt was that Jehovah, that ſaid unto all Iſrael, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me: Thou</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118698:6"/>
                     <hi>ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven Images, thou ſhalt not bow down to worſhip them;</hi> but thou ſhalt worſhip me alone, with ſuch outward worſhip, as I have already appointed, or as I ſhall now appoint at this Mount Sinai, or which I ſhall hereafter appoint, when the Throne of my Tabernacle ſhall be reared up.</p>
                  <p>So then, Chriſt was that Jehovah that firſt promiſed the Land of Canaan, unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. and that ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to bring them out of Egypt, and that kept them company in the wilderneſſe, by going before them in a cloudy pillar by day, and in a fiery pillar by night, untill he brought them into the land of Canaan<hi>:</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth tell us plainly, that it was Chriſt that cauſed the <hi>rock to ſupply them with water in the wildernes,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. Therefore it followes that it muſt needs be Jeſus Chriſt that did not only unite the twelve Tribes, into one Nationall Church, but alſo that did diſtribute them into ſeverall particular Church-Aſſemblies<hi>:</hi> And therefore it was Chriſt that appointed all the Ordinances of his worſhip by <hi>Moſes,</hi> both their national, and in their particular Church-Aſſemblies.</p>

                     <hi>How do you prove that Jeſus Chriſt did diſtribute the twelve Tribes into ſeveral particular Church-Aſſemblies.</hi>

                  <speaker>Teacher,</speaker>
                  <p>I prove it by a place of Scripture, that is both plain and pregnant, Lev. 23. 1, 2, 3. Jehovah ſpake unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Speak unto the ſons of Iſrael, and ſay unto them,</hi> &amp;c. and in verſe 3. he ſaith thus, <hi>Six dayes ſhall work be done, but in the ſeventh day ſhall be a Sabbath of Sabbatiſm, a convocation of holineſſe, ye ſhall not do any work, it ſhall be a Sabbath to Iehovah in all your dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this Text, Jeſus Chriſt is called Jehovah, he bade <hi>Moſes</hi> (the chief Magiſtrate) to ſpeak unto the ſons of Iſrael, that is to ſay, to the chief Sons or Elders of Iſrael; as he doth explain his meaning in <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. 1. 3. There <hi>Moſes</hi> bids <hi>Aaron</hi> to ſpeak unto the ſons of Iſrael; that is to ſay the 70. to the Senate of Iſrael in the firſt place, <note place="margin">Exod. 25. 1. 9. Numb. 11.</note> that ſo by their means all the other ſons of Iſrael might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the commandment of Chriſt, concerning the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his publike worſhip. And ſo it was Chriſt alſo, that bad <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſet the judiciall Laws before them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 1. that is to ſay, before the chief ſons of Iſrael in the firſt place, and ſo by their means before all the people alſo; and by this orderly way, Chriſt did communicate all his Laws, and Ordinances to all the people, ſee <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 29. &amp; 12. 3. compared with 21. &amp; with Num. 5. 1. &amp; 30. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118698:6"/>
Then Chriſt by <hi>Moſes</hi> bade theſe chief ſons of Iſrael to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Convocations of Holineſs, that all the people might know the appointment of Chriſt<hi>:</hi> and Chriſt did command theſe chief ſons of Iſrael to proclaim unto the people the obſervation of two ſeveral kinds of holy Convocations. Firſt, particular Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Holineſs, or particular Church-Aſſemblies, which they muſt obſerve every ſeventh Day in all their dwellings, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23, 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By general Convocations of Holineſs, or general Church-Aſſemblies, which they muſt obſerve before his Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary <hi>three times a year,</hi> verſe 4. and ſo to thee and of the Chapter</p>
                  <p>Now, the firſt ſort of theſe holy Convocations ſpoken of, verſ. 3. muſt needs be underſtood of their particular Church-Aſſemblies, for this phraſe, <hi>In all your dwellings:</hi> cannot be underſtood nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Family-Aſſemblies, nor yet of their Nationall Church-Aſſemblies; therefore it muſt be underſtood of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church-Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt I ſay, that this Convocation which Chriſt commanded them to keep every ſeventh Day in all their dwellings, cannot be underſtood of their Family-Convocations. It is a groſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit for any man to think that Chriſt did by this phraſe, command every Family to ſtay at home to keep a Convocation in every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Family. Secondly, it is as groſſe a conceit to think, that Chriſt did, by this phraſe, command all the twelve Tribes to keep a general Convocation before the Sanctuary, every ſeventh Day, eſpecially after they were ſetled in the Land of Canaan, in their ſeveral Inheritances: any man that hath but half an eye, may ſee that ſuch a Convocation was impoſſible to be obſerved every ſeventh Day. Therefore it follows by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the holy Convocation which Chriſt did command them to keep every ſeventh Day in all their dwellings, muſt be underſtood of ſuch particular Church-Convocations, as were made of ſeveral Families, in a convenient diſtance of place for every ones dwelling. The truth of this Interpretation will the better appear, if we do but conſider two circumſtantial differences. 1. Of Time. 2. Of Place. Firſt, of Time: This Convocation ſpoken of in verſe 3. is expreſly commanded to be obſerved every Sabbath, or ſeventh Day through all the year, even during the time of their travel in the wilderneſſe; therefore this Convocation can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood of their general Church-Convocations: for their general feſtival Convocations were commanded to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118698:7"/>
only three times in the year: neither were they bound to obſerve their feſtival Convocations in the time of their travels in the wilderneſs, but the obſervation of thoſe Convocations were adjourned until they were ſettled in reſt, in the Land of Canaan, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this Convocation of holineſs, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 3. Differs from their National-Convocation in reſpect of place, becauſe their National-Convocation was commanded to be obſerved only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tabernacle or Temple, which place was a great way off from the moſt part of their dwellings, after they were ſetled in Canaan. But this Convocation of holineſſe, in verſe 3. is at hand, and therefore it is commanded to be obſerved in all their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; that is to ſay, not far off, but nigh to every ones dwelling, ſo that all ſorts of perſons might reſort thither with eaſe, every Sabbath or ſeventh Day, without breaking the reſt of the holy Sabbath by long toyl of travel; for the Text ſaith plainly, <hi>Yee ſhall not do any work, it ſhall be a Sabbath to Jehovah, in all your dwellings;</hi> but if all the twelve Tribes had been commanded to repaire to the Tabernacle, or Temple every Sabbath or ſeventh Day, they muſt have toyled hard, and ſo have broken the reſt of the holy Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing this Convocation in verſe 3. is ſo expreſly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited. 1. To the time of the Sabbath or ſeventh Day. And 2. to the place of their dwellings; that is to ſay, in a convenient nigh diſtance to their dwellings. It doth neceſſarily follow that this Convocation of holineſſe ſpoken of in verſe 3. muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only of their particular Church-Aſſemblies, which Chriſt ordained as well as their general Church-Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 2. <hi>That Jehovah loveth the Gates of Zion, above the dwelling places of Iacob.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is to ſay, Chriſt did more delight to manifeſt his viſible Preſence in the Cloud of his preſence, between the Cherubin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mount Sion, then in their Synagogue-Aſſemblies: but he did graciouſly bleſſe their Synagogue-Aſſemblies with his Spiritual preſence to the converſion of ſouls, as he did the place of his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſence in Mount Sion.</p>
                  <p>But I chiefly alledge this place in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. to note out unto us, that their particular Church-Aſſemblies, were called <hi>the dwelling places of Iacob,</hi> becauſe they were many, and conveniently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in all the Towns and Villages of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118698:7"/>
Secondly, if Jeſus Chriſt had left his people to their own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and diſcretion, whether they would have met together in particular Church-Aſſemblies, to worſhip him every Sabbath or no, all the while they were in their travels in the wildernes, which was for the ſpace of thirty eight years together; Then doubtleſs they would have uſed that liberty to the increaſing of Idolatry, and profaneneſs, as experience doth teach us in all places where the ſtrict exerciſe of Gods worſhip in particular aſſemblies hath been neglected; and then the generation that entred into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, would have been worſe then thoſe that came out of Egypt, but they muſt be better inſtructed before they could enter into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan; therefore there was a neceſſitie that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn them to obſerve particular Convocations of holineſs, by particular Church-Aſſemblies every Sabbath or ſeventh Day, even whiles they were in their travels in the wilderneſſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>What other proof have you to confirm this Tenent, that the Iewes Synagogues were particular Churches of Ieſus Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Teacher,</speaker>
                  <p>The truth of this Tenent doth further appear by the term Church, and the term Synagogue, which are uſed as terms convertible or <hi>ſynonima.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> calls a Chriſtian Church a Synagogue, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. 2. <hi>If there come</hi> ſaith he, <hi>unto your Synagogue, a man with a gold ring,</hi> &amp;c. Here the term Synagogue, in the ſingular number is put for Synagogues in the plural number; for <hi>Iames</hi> writes not to one particular Church or Synagogue onely, but he writes to the converted <hi>Iewes</hi> of the twelve Tribes which were diſperſed into divers heathen Countries, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 1. For they had Synagogues in every heathen Countrey, and they had many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtians that ſtill lived with them, though ſome were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into particular Churches: <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith to them all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as if he ſpake to one particular Church meeting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>David</hi> calls the Jewes-Synagogues by the name of Churches, as M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> noteth in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 12. In the Churches, ſaith he, will I bleſſe thee: And again <hi>David</hi> doth exhort <hi>all the faithfull to bleſſe God in the Churches, Pſalm.</hi> 68. 26. That is to ſay, in their particular Synagogue-meetings: ſo then by the Teſtimony of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> it is evident that the term Church, and the term Synagogue, are terms convertible or <hi>ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonima.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118698:8"/>
Thirdly, The ſeventy do make the terme Church, and the terme Synagogue to be <hi>Synonima.</hi> Theſe ſeventy Tranſlators were Jewes, and therefore in reaſon were able to render the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word <hi>Kahal</hi> (which we tranſlate Church) in a right ſenſe; and they tranſlate <hi>Kahal</hi> ſeventy times by <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> and thirty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times by <hi>Synagogue:</hi> as <hi>Kirkerus</hi> in his Hebrew-Greek <hi>Lexicon</hi> doth note it to our hands.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Prophet lamenteth, that <hi>the enemy had burned all the Synagogues of God in the land,</hi> Pſal. 74. 4. 8. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calls them the Synagogues of God, becauſe they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ordained by Jeſus Chriſt, for the uſe of his publike worſhip every Sabbath day.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, that if any of the Jewiſh Synagogues in the dayes of the Apoſtles did embrace the Goſpel, they might well be called a Chriſtian Church, without any alteration of their Diſcipline; as the whole Synagogue of Antioch in Syria did<hi>:</hi> (for I believe there was a Jewiſh Synagogue in that City, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were many Jews there, though the terme Synagogue be not expreſſed in the text) For as yet the Apoſtles preached to the Jews onely: <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 29. and therefore that Synagogue might well continue in the ſame order of Diſcipline as it ſtood before<hi>:</hi> and why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible, that a whole Synagogue might not be converted by the preaching of the Goſpel, as well as whole Families; ſeeing the Jews of this Antioch, did not oppoſe the believing Grecians, as the malignant Jews of other Synagogues did? we never read of any oppoſition that this Church or Synagogue made againſt the Goſpel, except by ſome Jews that came from Judea, and taught the Brethren, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Except ye be circumciſed after the manner of Moſes, ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved.</hi> Acts 15. 1. Neither do we read of any ſeparation that Chriſtians made from this Synagogue, as they did from other Synagogues when they were perſecuted. Therefore I conceive all the Jews of this Synagogue were converted in general: and this Synagogue was firſt called a Church of Chriſtians. <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 26. and yet there were ſynagogues in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, that were called Churches before this: <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. but they were not wholy converted to Chriſtianity, as this ſynagogue of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch was<hi>:</hi> ſome godly converts there were in theſe ſynagogues by the miniſtry of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and of Chriſt, who had ſome reſt from perſecution, at the time of <hi>Paul</hi>'s converſion; but no ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118698:8"/>
Chriſtian Church was eſtabliſhed as yet, except the Church at Jeruſalem, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 15. and except this ſynagogue of Antioch.</p>
                  <p>5. When <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent with letters from the high Prieſt, to perſecute Chriſtians that as yet continued in ſynagogues; he was converted as he was going to perſecute the Chriſtians that were in the ſynagogue of Damaſcus; whereupon he preached Chriſt in the ſynagogue of Damaſcus, and then he preached Chriſt alſo in the ſynagogues of Arabia, for three yeers together, before he conſulted with any of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 1. 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1, &amp; 2. <hi>Then had the Churches reſt, throughout all Iudea, Galilee, and Samaria.</hi> Acts 9. 31. Theſe Churches can be no other but the ſynagogues of thoſe places where divers of them were converted to Chriſtianity by the preaching of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, where they yet continued<hi>:</hi> For I find no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Chriſtian Church eſtabliſhed as yet, but the Church at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem and at Antioch, as I noted above. In one place <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that <hi>He perſecuted the Church of God extremely, and waſted it.</hi> Gal. 1. 13. but in <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 19. he ſaith, <hi>He priſoned and beat in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſynagogue, them that believed in Chriſt.</hi> Therefore the Jews ſynagogues may well be called particular Churches of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Some learned men do affirm, that the Iews Synagogues were no true Particular Churches of Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe they wanted one of the eſſential marks of a true Particular Church: For according to the opinion of ſundry learned Divines, a true Church muſt have three marks that are eſſential to the completing of a true Church. Firſt, The preaching of Gods word by a choſen Officer. Secondly, The right adminiſtration of the Sacraments. Thirdly, the power of Diſcipline: Now it is evident that the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues wanted the uſe and practiſe of the two Sacraments, which were in ordinary uſe before the coming of Chriſt. Therefore they were no true Churches of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <speaker>Teacher.</speaker>
                  <p>This is a hard ſaying, to condemn the Jews ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, as no true Churches of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they did not Adminiſter thoſe Sacraments, that were in ordinary uſe among the Jewes. If there can be no true Church of Jeſus Chriſt without the Adminiſtration of the ordinary Sacraments, then thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-Aſſemblies were no true Churches of Jeſus Chriſt, which were often Congregated at <hi>Amerſham,</hi> and in other parts in <hi>England,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, to hear the Word of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118698:9"/>
God read and expounded, by the ableſt Chriſtians they would chuſe out among themſelves: for I conceive they did many years meet together to hear the Word of God, without the uſe of the Sacraments, and without the uſe of any ſettled Diſcipline, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſe of ſuch private reproofs, as they in godly wiſedome did give to one another for the reformation of ſinful miſdemeanours: though I grant that ſuch Aſſemblies had the uſe of the Sacraments, and of Diſcipline alſo in the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> but not in the dayes of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, that I can find recorded in any ſtory; and yet I conceive there were many true particular Churches of Jeſus Chriſt in thoſe dayes. Therefore I conceive that in time of perſecution, where ever a company of godly Chriſtians did uſe to aſſemble upon the Lords-Day to hear the Word of God preached by one of the moſt ableſt choſen men among themſelves, they were to be eſteemed as a true particular Church of Jeſus Chriſt, or elſe I fear we ſhall hardly find any true Church of Chriſt in the world, for many years together in the height of Popery.</p>
                  <p>Therefore notwithſtanding this Objection, I conclude that the Jewes ſynagogues were true Churches of Jeſus Chriſt, as long as they had the uſe and exerciſe of the Word preached among them, though they wanted the uſe of the ordinary Sacraments in their ſynagogues, and yet I ſuppoſe they circumciſed in their ſynagogues, for they came to the Adminiſtration of that ſeal of the Covenant in a publick manner, as Learned Divines think, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 59.</p>

From this text it is evident, that Jeſus Chriſt had given them a commandment and a law, for the publike ſanctifying of the holy Sabbath, before he gave the ten commandments at mount Sinai: and therefore he had inſtructed them in the obſervation of their feſtival ſabbaths; for he did not require them to obſerve their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival ſabbaths while they were in their travels in the Wildernes, but he adjourned the obſervation of their feſtival ſabbaths, until they were ſetled in reſt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> Numb. 15. 2. and therefore after Chriſt had commanded the Tabernacle to be twice erected in the Wildernes, for the place of their National Church-Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and after that he had declared the Ordinances thereof (which was done in the ſecond yeer after their coming from Aegypt) then, immediately after the Tabernacle was folded up again, 38. yeers together, as M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> obſerved, <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. In all which ſpace, they did not obſerve any of their feſtival ſabbaths, except the Paſs-over once onely, in the ſecond yeer after they came out of Aegypt. <hi>Num.</hi> 9. And yet in all this 38. yeers ſpace, the Angel of Gods preſence did not leave them to their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, whether they would obſerve the ſabbath by an holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation or no<hi>:</hi> but he did ſtraitly charge them to obſerve that day with an holy convocation in all their dwellings; they might not omit this holy convocation every ſeventh day in all their dwellings; though they muſt omit the obſervation of all their feſtival ſabbaths for 38. yeers togethers<hi>:</hi> If they had neglected their Particular Church-Aſſemblies, as they did omit their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church-Aſſemblies, for 38. yeers together, doubtleſs Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would have periſhed from among them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, after they did enjoy their National Church-Aſſemblies <note place="margin">Their National Church-worſhip, was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of it ſelf to preſerve the truth of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. But their Synagogue worſhip was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient without National wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, both when they lived in the Wildernes, and when they lived in heathen coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> three times a yeer, Religion would have periſhed among them, if it had not been for this command of Chriſt, to obſerve thoſe particular Church-Aſſemblies in all their dwellings.</p>
                  <p>And this is evident, by conſidering the defects that were in their National Church-worſhip<hi>:</hi> 1. In regard of Perſons. 2. Of Place. 3. Of time.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſider the Perſons that were enjoyned to be preſent at their National Church-Aſſemblies; and they were but ſome part of thoſe perſons that were to be inſtructed in Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: For neither bond-men, nor women, nor children, were bound to be preſent at any of their National Church-meetings,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118698:10"/>
onely men that were free, were commanded to meet three times a year<hi>: vid. Ainſw.</hi> on <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 17. Therefore their National Church-Aſſemblies, were never intended by Chriſt as the chief means to train up all ſorts of Perſons in faith and holines.</p>
                  <p>2. Conſider the place that the Son of God appointed for their National Church meetings, and that was ſet but in one of their Tribes, which the Lord would chuſe; therefore all ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons could not come thither every ſabbath day, in regard of the length of the way; for the place was a great way off from moſt of their dwellings. Therefore the moſt men could not come thither every ſabbath, eſpecially if any infirmity were upon them; and if it had been poſſible for all ſorts of perſons to aſſemble every ſabbath unto the Lords Temple, yet ſo great a multitude could neither hear the voice of the Prieſts, nor yet ſee the publike ſacrifices with their eyes; and in that regard, every one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to the National Church-Aſſembly, were commanded by Chriſt to bring their own private ſacrifice over and above the publike, and not to come before the Lord emptie. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the place of their National Church meetings, was never intended by Chriſt, as the onely Church meeting of the Iſraelites, for the training up of all ſorts of perſons every ſeventh day in faith and holines.</p>
                  <p>3. Conſider the time of this National Church-worſhip, and that was commanded to be done, (not every ſabbath or ſeventh day) but onely three times a yeer, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 14. 17. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. Therefore it muſt needs follow by neceſſary conſequence, that this National Church-Aſſembly, was never intended by Chriſt as the onely Church-meeting for Iſrael<hi>:</hi> and therefore Chriſt muſt needs eſtabliſh ſome other particular Church-meetings for holy convocations in all their dwellings, to be obſerved every ſeventh day, as the moſt conſtant and familiar way and means for the education of all ſorts of Gods people in faith and holines: and what other particular convocations could Iſrael have in all their dwellings, but their ſynagogue-aſſemblies, whither all ſorts of people might eaſily reſort every ſabbath? Bondmen as well as Freemen; Children as well as the moſt Ancient; Women as well as Men; Proſelites as well as Iſraelites; yea Heathens might come thither to be inſtructed, though they might not come into the holy Temple. And theſe holy convocations in all their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, were commanded to be obſerved in the Wildernes, while
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118698:10"/>
they were in their travels, as well as in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> when they came thither. Yea they obſerved theſe particular Church-Aſſemblies in all Heathen Countries, when they were in diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Chriſt did not leave them in any place of their captivity, free from the obſervation of the holy ſabbath, in the beſt manner they could attain; but he did fully free them from all their National Church-worſhip when they were in captivity in heathen coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: but he commanded them to obſerve his National Church-worſhip, but only in that particular place which he had choſen in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and not in heathen Countries, nor in the Wildernes.</p>
                  <p>From the due conſideration of theſe three circumſtances, the Angel from whom <hi>Moſes</hi> received lively Oracles, doth plainly ſhew unto us, that there was an abſolute neceſſity why he muſt diſtribute the National Church of the Jews, into particular Church-Aſſemblies, in a convenient diſtance among all their dwellings, for the better inſtruction of all ſorts of people, every ſabbath or ſeventh day, in faith and holines.</p>

                     <hi>I confeſs you have given me good ſatisfaction in this point: I do conceive that Chriſt did diſtribute the National Church of the Iews into ſundry particular Churches, in a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient diſtance among all their dwellings, for the better inſtructing of all ſorts of people every ſabbath in faith and holines; not onely in Canaan, but in the Wildernes, and in all places of their diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; by means whereof they did preſerve the truth of Religion, till the coming of Chriſt, better then the Iews did in Canaan, where they did for the moſt part enjoy the free uſe of their National Church-Worſhip. And Chriſt did much honour theſe diſperſed Synagogues, with the converſion of many ten thouſand ſouls, both of Iews and Heathens, by ſending abroad his Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to preach the glad tydings of the Goſpel among them.</hi>

                  <p>I am glad that you are now ſatisfied that the Iews ſynagogues were eſtabliſhed by Chriſt as his particular Churches<hi>:</hi> now ſeeing you grant their ſynagogues to be true Churches, you muſt allow their Diſcipline to be according to the mind of Chriſt<hi>:</hi> and indeed Chriſt did highly honour this point of Diſcipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in that their Officers did ſo freely give way to the Apoſtles and Diſciples to preach in their ſynagogues. This free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and liberty was a commendable cuſtom among them, and it was well rewarded with plentiful preaching, and converſion of ſouls all the world over.</p>

                  <p>The Iews were ſcattered abroad into the four winds of heaven, by the juſt anger of Chriſt for their Apoſtaſie, but in the midſt of wrath he remembred mercy; for at laſt he gave them favour in the ſight of all Nations, to have and build ſynagogues for the free ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rciſe of their Religion.</p>
                  <p>As for example, in the daies of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> the Perſian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <note place="margin">The antiquity of Synagogues in heathen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> 
                     <hi>Haman</hi> did inform the King that there was a people which were diſperſed in all his Dominions (which was an hundred twenty and ſeven Provinces) that had laws differing from all Nations, and differing from the Kings laws, and he perſwaded the King it was not fit for him to ſuffer them to live. <hi>Eſt.</hi> 3. 8. Now if <hi>Haman</hi> had been asked what laws had the Iews differing from all Nations, and differing from the Kings laws? I believe he could have found no other laws peculiar to them, and differing from other Nations, but the laws and Ordinances of Ieſus Chriſt, which they publikely preached and taught in their ſynagogues every ſabbath, in all the ſaid hundred twenty and ſeven Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. From this accuſation of <hi>Haman,</hi> it may be ſafely gathered, that the Iews had abundance of ſynagogues in all the hundred twenty and ſeven Provinces of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> Dominions.</p>
                  <p>And we may gueſs, they began to build ſynagogues in the time of the Babylonian Captivity, for Chriſt did procure favour for the poor captives at the hands of the Babylonian Emperors, as well as of the Perſian, by many ſtately paſſages of his wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: For about the fifth yeer of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> he cauſed <hi>Daniel</hi> to be advanced into the Kings favour, by giving him skill <note place="margin">The provident care of Chriſt for ſpeedy ſpreading of particular Chriſtian Church<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es into all parts of the world, doth mightily appear by his diſperſing the Iews into ſundry heathen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to have Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, and to get Aſſemblies before-hand, fit for the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt to preach the Goſpel to.</note> to tell and to expound <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi>'s dreams; and then he procured them another new favour, by delivering the three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Martyrs out of the fiery furnace. Thirdly, <hi>Daniel</hi> obtained another new favour of <hi>Darius Madai,</hi> fellow in government with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> when Chriſt did ſo miraculouſly deliver him from the power of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ungry lyons. Fourthly, Chriſt cauſed <hi>Eſter</hi> and <hi>Mordecai</hi> to be highly advanced into favour with <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and with <hi>Darius Artaxerxes</hi> his ſon: and thus it pleaſed Chriſt by theſe ſtately paſſages of his providence, to procure favour for all the Iews in general that were diſperſed into ſeveral heathen Countries for the building of ſynagogues for the free exerciſe of their Religion. And though <hi>Haman</hi> plotted the overthrow of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118698:11"/>
their Religion, yet through the wiſe providence of Chriſt (to whom the Father gave all authoritie and power) <hi>Haman</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown with all his <hi>Amalakite</hi> party, who had determined the death of the Iews in every Province. Then the fear of the Iews fel upon the Heathens, and many heathens became Proſelites, <hi>Eſter</hi> 8. 17. that is to ſay, they did aſſociate themſelves with the Iewes, to worſhip God, with them in their ſynagogues.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Lord Chriſt by theſe ſtately paſſages of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, did promote ſome of the Iews to ſpecial favour with the heathen Emperours, by whoſe favour the reſt obtained favour for the erecting of ſynagogues, and for the exerciſe of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in all Countries.</p>
                  <p>Nay, It appears to me that the Iews began to have and build ſynagogues in heathen Countries in the dayes of <hi>Nebuchad-ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> and in the time of <hi>Ieremies</hi> preaching, for he and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did aſſure them that <hi>Nebuchad-nezar</hi> ſhould conquer the land and lay it waſt for ſeventy years, thereupon many Godly Iews did ſell their eſtates and flee away, as they could get opportunitie into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers heathen countries aforehand, either unto Babel before they were captivated, or elſe into ſome of thoſe hundred twenty ſeven Provinces above-mentioned, even as <hi>Elias</hi> fled from the face of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> ſo did many Godly Iews flee from perſecuting Princes, Prieſts and Prophets into divers heathen countries for ſafety; for God had his out-caſts that did hide themſelves from the evil day, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 16. 3. 4. <hi>Ier.</hi> 40. 11, 12. and 43. 5, 6, 7. and 44. 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 12. and of the number of theſe out-caſts they might well be who had and built ſynagogues in Corinth and Rome and other remote parts, as Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> thinks in Lam. 1. 3.</p>
                  <p>And Chriſt Ieſus did provide by his ſpecial providence, that theſe ſynagogues ſhould be made famous and eminent for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Godlines in all heathen Countries, for many heathens were affected to religion, and became Proſelites, and many did accompany the Iews that returned with <hi>Zorobabel</hi> that could not diſcerne their fathers houſe, whether they were of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> or no, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. 59. 60. and by this quaere into their genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy it appears that the rulers of the Iews did conceive that there were ſome heathens among them that had been ſo long joyned to their Church, that they could not finde out their pedigree, whether they were <hi>Iſraelites</hi> or no. And though forty nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Iews returned at the firſt, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. and many after, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118698:12"/>
thouſands did continue in all Nations, and did exerciſe their Religion in particular Church-aſſembies, which Church is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt was preached among them: as in Babylon, they had a ſynagogue, if not more then one: for the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (neer 500. years after) converted many ſouls to Chriſt there: and dated his firſt Epiſtle from thence, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
                  <p>2. Jeſus Chriſt did ſtill more and more diſperſe the Jewes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Chaldean</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> times, by the interchangeable wars that continued long between the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and the <hi>Lagidae,</hi> the two legs of the Image; <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. for the ſeat of their war was for the moſt part in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and in the Countries adjacent. And when the <hi>Celeucidae</hi> prevailed, they led captive many Jews into the Eaſterne and Northern parts. But when the <hi>Lagidae</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, they led many Jews captive into Egypt, and the parts adjacent. And thus Chriſt the Lord uſed theſe Tyrants as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to diſperſe the Jews all the world over, to build Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues for the exerciſe of Religion, and for the inſtructing and converting of many heathens, and for the uſe of the Apoſtles and of other Apoſtolick men, that by this means they might have a free and ready entrance to preach the Goſpel, to the converſion of many ten thouſands both of Jews and Heathens. And thus the Lord Jeſus did before-hand prepare a way for the ready preaching of the Goſpel all the world over<hi>:</hi> and then, when he was ready to leave the Apoſtles behinde him, he commanded them to go unto all Nations, to teach and baptize them into the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was ſo induſtrous, that he did quickly make the word of God to abound from Ieruſalem to Illyricum, and alſo to Rome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 14. for he found ready to his hand, many Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues in all places where he came<hi>:</hi> when he came firſt to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus he found Synagogues there, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 2. 20. and at Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 5. at Antioch in Piſidia, chap. 13. 14. at Iconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, chap. 14. 1. at Theſſalonica, 17. 10. at Athens, chap. 17. at Corinth, 18. 4. at Epheſus, chap. 18. 19. at Philippi, there was a place for publique worſhip, chap. 16. 13. and by the opportunitie of theſe Synagogues, <hi>Paul</hi> had a ready entrance to preach the Goſpel every-where, to the converſion of many ten thouſand Iews, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 20. The Lord Ieſus Chriſt by the ſeven eyes of his providence, prepared theſe Synagogues, by diſperſing the Iews all the world over, to build them for the preſervation of Religion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118698:12"/>
and for the ſpreading thereof: and then the Lord did alſo make a gracious promiſe to the Iews that went into diſperſion, that they ſhould honour him, by ſetting up his pure worſhip in all thoſe heathen countries where they were captived, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 8. 9. 10. <hi>Zac.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 16. and 12. 16. and this propheſie was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by the Iews practice of Religion, in one hundred twenty and ſeven Provinces, <hi>Eſter</hi> 3. 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 5. and 21. 20. And Chriſt did honour theſe diſperſed Iews by ſending his Apoſtles to preach in their Synagogues, and by dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating a great part of the New Teſtament to the faithfull that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among them; for <hi>Peter</hi> wrote two Epiſtles to them, and <hi>Iames</hi> wrote an Epiſtle to the twelve Tribes that were in diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote ſeverall Epiſtles to them, and <hi>Paul</hi> wrote an Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in generall.</p>

As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Chriſt ſaith thus, every ſeventh day ye ſhall obſerve a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of holineſſe in all your dwellings, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 3. Hence <note place="margin">Ieſus Chriſt did ordain that the place of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church-worſhip ſhould bee conveniently ſeated for their dwellings.</note> it is evident that the place of their holy convocations muſt be ſo conveniently diſpoſed, that they might come to them without bodily toyl; for the Text ſaith, that no work muſt be done upon that day.</p>
                  <p>2. There is another general rule which Chriſt gave them, for the conveniencie of place, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 29. <hi>Let no man goe out of his place upon the ſeventh day:</hi> by this limitation Chriſt doth not prohibit men to go out of their private dwellings upon the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, for the Text doth command holy convocations upon the ſabbath, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. which cannot be done except men go out of their private houſes to make a convocation. But by this prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, <hi>Let no man go out of his place upon the ſabbath:</hi> The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Doctors underſtand it as a general prohibition, that no man ſhould go <hi>far</hi> from his private dwelling, to the publick place of Gods worſhip, upon the ſabbath. But ſtill the diſtance is not expreſſed, therefore it is left to the wiſdom of Godly ſuperiours to ſet down ſome convenient order therein<hi>:</hi> Therefore theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt doe contain as much in them as is contained in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118698:13"/>
thoſe other general commands in the New Teſtament, <hi>Let all things be done to edification,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. And <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. Hence it is evident that there are many particular circumſtances about the manner of Gods worſhip, which are not expreſſed, but are left only to the Godly wiſdom of ſuperiours to order and determine. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Hebrew Doctors took care to ſettle an order touching the diſtance of place, how far off the ſynagogue muſt be ſet from every ones dwelling; and by their order they did not allow men to go above two thouſand cubits upon the ſabbath. <hi>Kimchi</hi> in his Annotations upon <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 48. 7. ſaith that two thouſand cubits are a mile, (meaning an Italian or Engliſh mile:) and from this ancient Hebrew decree, the ſpeech of a ſabbath dayes journey was common among the Jews: and in this ſenſe <hi>Luke</hi> doth Thalmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, ſaying, that mount Olivet was a ſabbath dayes journey from Jeruſalem, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>vid. Ainſ.</hi> on Exod. 16. 29. And by this Godly Hebrew decree we may ſee that the vaſt diſtance of ſome meeting-houſes in England, are ſo far off from ſome mens dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings that they cannot come thither on the Lords day, unleſſe they travel and toil for it three or four miles together, by means of which travel they are more fit to ſleep at Gods worſhip then to attend it as they ought to do.</p>
                  <p>But in caſe no good preaching be to be had neer to every ones dwelling, or in caſe there be far more excellent means to be had further off, What then is to be done? Then I conceive the point of conveniencie muſt give way to the point of neceſſity, as in the dayes of Chriſt, they flocked to his Miniſtery from their own ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, and yet he did not rebuke them for it, as a ſin.</p>

                     <hi>What would you have thoſe men to do whoſe habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are three or four miles diſtant from the place of Gods publique worſhip? would you have them to forſake the place of their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation where their inheritance lies, or where the means of their livelihood lies, to dwell in a neer diſtance to the meeting-houſe?</hi>

                  <p>Either they ought to remove neerer to the place of publike worſhip, or elſe they ought to provide a place for publike worſhip neere unto their habitations. The Hebrew Doctors <note place="margin">If ten men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did live re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from any ſynagogue, they muſt prepare a New Synagogue nigh to their dwellings.</note> did wiſely labour to ſtoppe this objection, and therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that where ever <hi>Ten men</hi> of Iſrael did live but above a mile from any ſynagogue, they ſhould prepare them another houſe for prayer, wherein they might aſſemble at all times of prayer. And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118698:14"/>
in Cities they compelled the Citizens to build them a ſynagogue, and to buy them a book of the Law, Prophets, and Scriptures. And it is evident that the Jews built ſynagogues in every ſmall place, And it is recorded by the Hebrew Doctors, that the Jews had of old four hundred Scholes and Synagogues within the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Jeruſalem, beſides what they had in other Cities and Towns, through all the Tribes in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and through all heathen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries whither-ſo-ever they were carried captive<hi>:</hi> in all places they did exceedingly multiply ſynagogues and ſcholes of learning, as the chiefeſt Nurſeries of Religion.

                     <hi>the Goſpel was preached to the Iews as it is unto us.

And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, they that would (having leave of the Ruler of the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue) ſpake upon thoſe ſcriptures. And this cuſtom was retained among them untill the dayes of the Apoſtles, as <hi>Luke</hi> doth witneſſe in <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 14, 15, 16. <hi>vid. H.

                  <p>The place of their publique worſhip they called <hi>Beth Hackten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> The Houſe of Doctrine: and ſometime they named it <hi>The Place of Prayer, Act.</hi> 16. 13. by the terme <hi>Prayer,</hi> they meant it was the place of Gods publike worſhip<hi>:</hi> They comprehended Preaching under the term <hi>Prayer,</hi> as we may ſee by <hi>Paul</hi>'s action, becauſe he preached in this place of Prayer, by whoſe preaching <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> and her houſhold were converted<hi>:</hi> and afterwards as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> were going to this place of Prayer <hi>a certain maid having a</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:118698:14"/>
                     <hi>ſpirit of Divination, cryed out, ſaying, Theſe are the ſervants of the moſt high God, which ſhew unto you the way of ſalvation.</hi> This Maid doth bear witneſſe that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> did ſomething elſe in this place, more then bare Prayer<hi>:</hi> for ſhe doth affirme that they <hi>did ſhew unto the people the way of ſalvation, by preaching Ieſus Chriſt in that place.</hi> Therefore this place was not only a <hi>place of</hi> bare <hi>Prayer</hi> only, but it was a place of Preaching alſo: and it is called <hi>The place where the women did meet:</hi> but it appears by verſ. 40. <hi>that men alſo did meet in this place,</hi> for they are called <hi>the brethren:</hi> It is called <hi>the place where the women did meet,</hi> in honour of <hi>Lydiaes</hi> converſion; but it was not a place for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men only, for it appears by <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>that men women and children, and all that could underſtand, did aſſemble themſelves to the preaching of the word of God:</hi> all ſorts of people might and muſt reſort to worſhip God in their ſynagogues: even unclean perſons as well as clean; and therefore the very lepers (which were the moſt contagious of all unclean perſons) had a place by themſelves in their ſynagogues, <hi>vid. Ainſw.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. 46. but no unclean perſon might come to the publique worſhip of God into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Temple.</p>
                  <p>So then their Synagogues were called <hi>the place of Prayer,</hi> by the figure <hi>Synocdoche,</hi> becauſe Prayer was a principal part of that worſhip which was uſed there; Prayer was the beginning and ending of every duty. When they read the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, they began and end with Prayer. But now the Jews have ſophiſticated the ancient gravitie of this duty, for the Jew that now reads in the ſynagogue, begins with Praiſing God, who choſe <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and delighteth in their moſt true words, likewiſe endeth with praiſing of God, who ſpeaketh and performeth, ſaith and eſtabliſheth, ſo that no one word faileth<hi>:</hi> then he prayes for the coming of <hi>Elias,</hi> and for the reſtoring of the pompous Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> by the <hi>Meſſiah. vid. H. Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> after the <hi>Petaroth</hi> in the <hi>Concent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the days of <hi>Ezra,</hi> this manner was more pure, for then <hi>they begun with ſolemne Prayer before they read the holy Scriptures, Neh.</hi> 8. 5. 6. <hi>and the King himſelf when he read the Law publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſeventh year in the feaſt of Tabernacles, he began with ſolemne Prayer, Deut.</hi> 31. 10, to 14. And the Hebrew Doctors ſay, <hi>that when the King was to read the Law publikely, they blew Trumpets through all Jeruſalem, to aſſemble the people: and they</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:118698:15"/>
                     <hi>ſet up a Pulpit of wood, and ſet it in the midſt of the Court yard, and the King went up, and ſate thereon, that they might hear him read: and all Iſrael that went up to the feaſt, gathered round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him: and the Miniſter of the ſynagogue took the book of the Law, and gave it to the Ruler of the Synagogue and the Ruler of the ſynagogue gave it to the Sagan of the Temple, and the Sagan of the Temple gave it to the high Prieſt, and the high Prieſt gave it to the King, to honour him before the multitude. And the King took it ſtanding, and if he would he ſate down, and opened it, and bleſſed God: and after he had bleſſed God, he read untill he had made an end; then he folded it up, and bleſſed God again after it: as the manner was to bleſſe God in the ſynagogues. Both the reading and the bleſſing was in the Holy tongue. vid. Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 11. This Hebrew record I bring for this purpoſe, to ſhew their ancient practice in bleſſing God, both before and after they read the holy Scripture in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues: for it is ſaid that <hi>the King bleſſed God before and after, as the manner was to bleſſe God in the Synagogues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when the King read the holy Scriptures, all the hearers were bound to prepare their hearts, and to make their ears atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and to hear with fear and reverence, and with joy and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, as in the day when the Law was given in Mount Synai.</hi> And though they were great wiſe men which knew the whole Law every whit, they were bound to hear with great attention; for <hi>the King is the Angel of the Congregation,</hi> to cauſe the word of God to be ſounded. <hi>(vid. Ainſw. ibid.)</hi> that is to ſay, the King is the Angel of the general Aſſembly, to cauſe the word of God to be heard on that day.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Sheliach Zibbur</hi> was the Angel of each particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to cauſe the word of God to be read and expounded in their ſynagogues every ſabbath day: therefore all their hearers were bound to make the like reparation, and to hear with great attentiveneſſe in their ſynagogues. <hi>And when the King read, or the chief Ruler, he muſt endervour to make the people underſtand the reading,</hi> as it is recorded in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> chap. 8. 8.</p>
                  <p>And the perſons that were bound to hear in the laſt day of the feaſt of Tabernacles, were not only men, but <hi>women and children, and the ſtranger that was within their gates, Deut.</hi> 31. 12. but yet <hi>no unclean perſon muſt come into this generall Aſſembly,</hi> as it is written in verſ. 11. <hi>When all Iſrael is come;</hi> but the uncleane were not fit to come, becauſe this general Church-Aſſembly was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118698:15"/>
kept at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in the Holy place. But no unclean Perſons were exempted from coming into their particular Church-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, for all were bound to come to their ſynagogue convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions every ſabbath; yea the very lepers which were the moſt contagious of all unclean perſons, they had a place prepared for them in their ſynagogues, as I noted it before.</p>
                  <p>And indeed their ſynagogue-Aſſemblies were in ſuch high <note place="margin">They uſed to keep weekly Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in their Synagogues.</note> eſteem among them, that they frequented thoſe Aſſemblies, not onely on the ſabbaths, but alſo they kept Lectures therein upon the week daies, for the better edification of Gods people in faith and holines. For when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had ended their preaching upon the ſabbath at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelites of that ſynagogue <hi>beſought them to preach the ſame ſermon again in the middle ſabbath:</hi> Acts 13. 42. That is to ſay, in the middle of the week, which they called the middle ſabbath; for they dated all the daies of the week from the ſabbath, thus; the firſt of the ſabbath, the ſecond of the ſabbath, the third, the fourth of the ſabbath, called here by <hi>Paul,</hi> The middle ſabbath<hi>:</hi> on this day it ſeems they kept a weekly lecture at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidia,</hi> and doubtles other ſynagogues in other places did the ſame: and in this regard the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth exhort <hi>Timothy to preach the Word, and to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon:</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 2. That is to ſay, be inſtant to preach the Word, not onely upon the ſabbath daies, but alſo in the week daies, in keeping Lectures<hi>:</hi> and this may be ſaid to be out of ſeaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe weekly Lectures is not ſo conſtantly and certainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as the ſabbath Lectures are; but it is a voluntary ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which we give to God out of our own time and labour.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118698:16"/>
not lawful for the Iews to offer ſacrifice, becauſe they had no Sanctuary, there they received Proſelites into their ſynagogue, by the performance of the two firſt actions onely, (and Women were received onely by Baptiſme) and he that was baptiſed, was baptiſed in the preſence of three, &amp;c. And in the land of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, when any heathen man or woman came to joyn themſelves to the Common-weal of Iſrael as a Proſelite, the Elders of the Iews made diligent enquiry after ſuch, leſt they came to get themſelves under the Law for ſome riches, or for ſome dignity, or for affection for marriage-ſake, with ſome Iewiſh man or woman: If no ſuch occaſion were found againſt them, then they made known unto them the weightines of the yoke of the Law, and the toyl that is in the doing thereof, above that which the people of other lands have: to ſee if they will leave off; if yet they will take them upon them, and not withdraw, and ſee that they come of love, they then receive them; as it is written, <hi>When</hi> Naomi <hi>ſaw that</hi> Ruth <hi>was ſtedfaſtly minded to go with her, left ſpeaking unto her, and embraced her.</hi> Ruth 1. 18.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Baptiſme was ever frequently uſed among the Jews, and doubtles it was in uſe from the begining of the World, as ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing was; and it is evident, that the Godly after the Flood, did uſe to baptiſe their bodies, and their wearing garments, when they were defiled by any polution: as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. and <hi>Christ</hi> commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ordain the uſe of Baptiſme among
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118698:16"/>
his People, as a ſigne of their ſanctification. But at the laſt, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ended all the Typical Ceremonies; then it pleaſed him to retain the uſe of Baptiſme ſtill, as the Sacramental Seal of our Juſtification; but he ordained it to be uſed in another form then it was before: For at firſt, every unclean perſon did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe himſelf, but now he ordained it to be adminiſtred by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Teachers to the end of the world as a ſign of our initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation into his Viſible Church, according to the uſe of it amongſt them, when they received Proſelytes into their ſynagogues: ſo in like ſort, from the uſe of the bread and wine at their volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feaſt of peace-offerings, which they uſually adjoyned to the Paſs-over<hi>: Jeſus Chriſt</hi> authoriſed his Sacramental Supper of part of that Bread and Wine for the comfort and confirmation of all Believers in particular Churches.</p>
                  <p>And when <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> began his Miniſtery, preaching <hi>that the Kingdom of Heaven was come;</hi> he began to enter men into the ſaid Kingdom by Baptiſme: and that action of his was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange among the Jews; <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 5, 6. they made ſome queſtion of his perſon that did it, but not of the uſe of Baptiſme. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 25. M. <hi>Broughton</hi> ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi> was not aſtoniſhment to the Jews for his Baptiſme, but for his perſon onely, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they demanded whether he were <hi>Elias,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or that <hi>Prophet</hi> named in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>2. When there was a queſtion between ſome of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the Jews about purifying; that is to ſay, about the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Baptiſmes, and <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptiſme, they made no oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptiſme, as a new upſtart device of his own brain: <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 23. 25. but they approved the uſe of Baptiſme.

                  <p>But the Hebrew Doctors did not receive Proſelytes by Baptiſm onely, as it were hand over head: but they put them upon tryal to ſee if they came out of love to the Law of God; and in this reſpect the Hebrew Doctors ſay thus, <hi>Moſes</hi> our maſter gave the inheritance of the Law of Commandments to <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely, as it is written, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 4. <hi>The inheritance of the Congregation of Iacob:</hi> And unto any other that the Nations that willingly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf as a Proſelyte, as it is written, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 15. <hi>As ye are, ſo ſhall the ſtranger be before the Lord.</hi> But whoſoever is not

And the Hebrew Doctors ſtiled the King <hi>Zeliach Zibbur,</hi> when he did read the book of the Law before the people, in the ſeventh yeer, the yeer of releaſe; and they gave him this Title, to dignifie his perſon; and to dignifie that religious action. <hi>Vid.

                  <p>From theſe conſiderations it is evident, That the Hebrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors gave this Title to the Paſtor of the ſynagogue, the better to deſcribe the excellencie of his Office, and to teach him and the people what excellent qualities ſuch Officers ought to have: For by this Title the people were directed how to make choiſe of a fit Teacher for their ſynagogue; namely, they were hereby directed

to make choiſe of one that was learned, wiſe, and godly; that ſo he might anſwer to the dignity of his Title.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By this Title every Paſtor was warned to behave himſelf ſutably, both in their inward frame of ſoul, and in their outward deportment and behaviour: and doubtles, at the firſt, the people made choiſe of ſuch as were grave in their outward at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre and deportment: and therefore when <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo much favoured of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>to ſhew him his glory,</hi> Exod. 33.

But <hi>Daniel</hi> of <hi>Iudah</hi> was not inferiour in learning to any <hi>Levit;</hi> Likewiſe thoſe three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Martrys and Confeſſors, who by faith is eſcaped the violence of fire. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>The Pope indeed will have all his Church-Miniſters to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the Common people, by the name <hi>Spiritualtie</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> to tye learning to them; but <hi>David</hi> had his <hi>Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> as learned in <hi>Moſes</hi> as any <hi>Levit,</hi> who by foreſight of Chriſt were valiant in battel; and <hi>Daniel</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> with <hi>Ananias, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarias,</hi> and <hi>Miſael,</hi> were the glory of the world, before <hi>Ezekiel</hi> of <hi>Levi</hi> was come to <hi>Babel:</hi> and it would be an honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, if all of wealth and leaſure were brought up in the Bible, in frame of Art, to know it throughly. <hi>Jehoſaphats</hi> memoriall is precious, becauſe he ſent ſome Princes (as well as ſome <hi>Levites)</hi> to teach and preach the faith, in the ſynagogues of <hi>Iudah.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 7. and it is like they were all chief Doctors of the high Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin Court.</p>

                     </hi> therefore the ſenſe of this phraſe cannot be ſo well opened, as by comparing it to their uſe and cuſtome.</p>
                  <p>Keys ſignifie Power and Authoritie: both Papiſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants agree thus far: but yet there is a great difference between them about the kind of Power<hi>:</hi> the Pope and his <hi>Clergy</hi> will have the <hi>Keys</hi> in this place, to ſignifie the Power of Government over mens ſouls and bodies alſo; becauſe the terme <hi>Keys,</hi> doth ſignifie ſo much in other ſcriptures. Yea, many Proteſtants will have the term <hi>Keys</hi> in this place, to ſignifie <hi>the power of Excommunication.</hi> But theſe interpretations will not agree to the <hi>Talmudical</hi> ſenſe; for the <hi>Talmud</hi> (from whence this phraſe is borrowed) doth mean it of the <hi>Key of Authoritie,</hi> to preach only; and not of the Key of authoritie to rule over mens bodies. When they made a Doctor at large, they did not give him power to rule over mens bodies, but they gave him power to preach only as a Doctor at large, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he might be called to ſome particular Place or Office; either as a Paſtor or Teacher to ſome Synagogue, or as an Elder to ſome one or other of their Sanhedrins.</p>
                  <p>Some Reformed Churches underſtand this Key of Authoritie to ſignifie the <hi>Power of Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, upon ſcandalous members;</hi> but conſidering that this phraſe is borrowed from the <hi>Talmud</hi> uſe and practiſe, I wiſh that this Expoſition of ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches may not in the end be turned into a ſpice of Pope-like power.</p>
                  <p>I grant that the Elders of the Synagogues in heathen Countries had the Key of authoritie, to execute the ſentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication upon ſcandalous and impenitent perſons<hi>:</hi> but that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of theirs muſt be fetched from other ſcriptures, and not from this phraſe in this Text: for this Text ſpeaks only of that Key of Power and Authoritie which our Saviour gave unto his Apoſtles to preach what was looſe, and what was bound in the Kingdom of Heaven, here upon earth.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt gave them Power and Authoritie to teach, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beleeved in the <hi>promiſed ſeed, ſhould be looſed from his ſinnes;</hi>

                  <p>And our Lord after his reſurrection, did again confirm his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles with new authoritie, to teach what was <hi>looſe, and what was bound, Ioh.</hi> 20. 23. and by the uſe of this phraſe at another time, he put them in minde of their Authoritie, to <hi>preach what is looſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18. I confeſſe that ſome do expound this Text to mean the <hi>Power of Excommunication;</hi> but yet reſerving to them all due reſpect, I take it to be meant only of their Authoritie to preach what is <hi>looſe, and what is bound.</hi> And I ſhall be ready to give ſome further reaſons of this Expoſition hereafter.</p>

                  <p>Four ſorts of Dialects are eſpecially to be marked in the New Teſtament. 1. Much of the New Teſtament is attique, or common Greek, ſuch as Heathens uſed for matters known to heathens; for no man will deny but that they which will move others, muſt ſpeak in ſuch a Dialect as is proper to their capacitie.</p>
                  <p>2. More of the New Teſtament is borrowed from the Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agint Tranſlation; and it was needfull that when the Apoſtles did relate to the Church ſuch things as concerned the Jews mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; they ſhould expreſſe it from the ſeventy tranſlation, which was in common uſe among them. Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> ſaith, that he <hi>gathered many thouſands of words out of the New Teſtament, which the Apoſtles took out of the Seventy: but lately</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I uſed the help of</hi> Kirkerus <hi>his Hebrew-Greek Concordance, for a book of which nature I would have given formerly an hundred pound ſterling: and</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am ſorry that our Vniverſitie ſtudents know not the uſe of this moſt profitable work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Much of the New Teſtament is Apoſtolike Greek: for as all faculties draw common terms to their Trades peculiar to each Trade: ſo do the Apoſtles, they fit many Greek words to the Hebrew in a new manner, differing from all others.</p>
                  <p>4. Much of the New Teſtament is <hi>Talmudique-Greek,</hi> being framed according to the Schole phraſes of the Hebrew Doctors; and of this laſt ſort I have given many inſtances already.</p>

When the Prophets were no more, and the Kings of the North and South, the two legs, <hi>(Dan.</hi> 2.) vexed <hi>Iudah</hi> ſtill with wars, then the Jews ſouldiers became Sadduces, rejecting the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of all the Prophets (but the five books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeak plainly of the place of ſouls after this life:) thereupon they denyed the immortalitie of the ſoule: for the cure of which Peſtilent errour. The better ſort of Hebrew Doctors (having but few in thoſe dayes that regarded <hi>Divinitie)</hi> enacted certain terms againſt the corrupt Tenets of theſe Athiſtical Sadduces.</p>
                  <p>They termed all the Old Teſtament, <hi>the Law,</hi> from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. and from <hi>Eſai.</hi> 8. And this term of theirs the New Teſtament doth imitate in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>They alſo enacted divers terms to ratifie the Doctrine of the ſoules immortalitie after this life is ended; as, <hi>the world of ſoules: the world to come: the day of Iudgement: the great day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the Kingdom of heaven: eating and drinking in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven: the feaſt of the Paſſeover in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: the place of Godly ſouls under Gods throne: Crowns for the Iuſt:</hi> and many ſuch like which the New Teſtament alloweth.</p>
                  <p>Alſo they enacted proper terms for the immortalitie of wicked ſoules; as <hi>Gehenna, the fire of Gehenna: frizing cold: gnaſhing of teeth: the ſecond death,</hi> &amp;c. this laſt phraſe is uſed in <hi>Onkelos,</hi> upon <hi>Deuterenomie</hi> 33. and in <hi>Ionathan</hi> upon <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 22. and in <hi>Zohar,</hi> and in many others.</p>
                  <p>They hold alſo in <hi>Abboth. Rabbi Nathan,</hi> that the Prophet <hi>Moſes</hi> and all faithful, at their death, are preſently carryed to Gods Throne, and that they reſt there under the Throne<hi>:</hi> and the New Teſtament uſeth the like ſpeech for the ſouls of the Martyrs under the Altar, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Hebrew Doctors teſtimony is cited by <hi>Paul,</hi> and by their <hi>Talmuds,</hi> for the very names of thoſe Sorcerer that reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <hi>Moſes,</hi> they call them <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> and ſo doth <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8. alſo the term <hi>Colyrion</hi> is from them, and <hi>the girding about the breaſt, as the High Prieſt was:</hi> juſt as it is expreſſed in <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. 13.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118698:23"/>
ancient <hi>Rabbins,</hi> as the <hi>Thalmud</hi> doth witneſſe. Alſo the terme <hi>Angels,</hi> as it is applyed to the ſeven Paſtors of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> is <hi>Talmudical:</hi> And <hi>Raca</hi> in the <hi>Talmud</hi> is a terme of contumelious reproach: and ſo <hi>Beelzebub</hi> in <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 22. is a contumelious term of reproach in the <hi>Talmud:</hi> alſo the <hi>Furlong</hi> of the New Teſtament is a <hi>Talmud</hi> terme, and ſo it differs from the Romane Furlong: for eight Romane Furlongs make an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh or Italian mile: but the <hi>Talmud</hi> allows but ſeven and a half to an Engliſh mile. Alſo the <hi>Talmud</hi> doth uſe the terme <hi>Dead,</hi> for ſuch as are profane in <hi>Zeror</hi> often: and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> uſe the ſame terme in their ſenſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1. Alſo the terme <hi>Mammon,</hi> for riches of iniquitie, is from them. Theſe and ſuch like words and phraſes, the New Teſtament doth often bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the ancient Hebrew Doctors, whereof many are yet to be ſeen in their <hi>Talmuds. vid.</hi> more in Mr <hi>Ainſw.</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Geneſis:</hi> and in his <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> at the end of <hi>Deuteronomie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence I inferre, that ſeeing the New Teſtament doth cite ſo many termes from the Hebrew Records, Why then may it not cite other termes from their Synagogues Diſcipline, ſeeing the N.

                     <hi>I cannot deny but that the New Teſtament may as well borrow its Diſoipline termes from their Synagogues Diſcipline, as it doth other termes from their Records. But I do much wonder why the Apoſtles ſhould write to Heathen Christians, after the Iewes peculiar vein, ſeeing ſuch Christians of the Heathens might be as much to ſeek in their Talmudical phraſes, as wee are at this day.</hi>

                  <p>I think not ſo: for I conceive that many heathen Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were firſt well inſtructed and bred up with the Jews in their Synagogues in all parts of their diſperſion: and heathen Chriſtians and converted Jews were conjoyned together in all Chriſtian Churches, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James</hi> do teſtifie in their ſeveral Epiſtles. Therefore the heathen Chriſtians in thoſe parts might be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their <hi>Talmudical</hi> phraſes, then we can be at this day: and therefore the Apoſtles might well garniſh their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Epiſtles, with ſeveral phraſes from the ancient Hebrew Doctors, as well as from their heathen writers: And by this means every Nation under heaven might ſee a ſweet accord between the Doctrine of the Goſpel and their beſt Writers.</p>

                     <hi>This is a ſtrong anſwer. Did</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>eſtabliſh ſuch a different order in the adminiſtration of their Synagogue-Diſcipline? This Tenent is contrary to the judgment of many learned Writers: For thoſe that are for Dependent Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, do affirm that way of Government to be the onely way that</hi> Chriſt <hi>hath eſtabliſhed for ever in all Particular Churches. On the contrary, thoſe that are for Independent Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do affirm their way is the only way that</hi> Chriſt <hi>hath ordained for ever in all particular Churches. Both ſides are confident of their way to be the only way, therefore one of theſe two waies muſt needs fall to the ground, as not being the only way of</hi> Chriſt. <hi>How then ſay you that the Jews Synagogue-Diſcipline was ſomtimes Dependent, and ſomtimes Independent?

               </sp>

                  <speaker>Teacher.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea <hi>Chriſt</hi> allowed of both theſe waies of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">The Iews Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue Diſcipline was ſomtime Dependent, and ſomtime Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.</note> becauſe he did put his ſynagogues into ſeveral capacities by difference of place and caſe: Therefore the word <hi>[onely]</hi> ought not to ſtate the caſe. As for example, whiles the Jews li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their own land, their ſynagogue diſcipline did depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Courts; becauſe Chriſt eſtabliſhed the Elders of their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Courts; as the general Elders of the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>2. But when the Jews were diſperſed by the hand of God into
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118698:24"/>
ſundry Heathen Countries, then Jeſus Chriſt did neceſſitate them <note place="margin">In heathen coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries every Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue had a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral licenſe to exerciſe ſuch a diſcipline among themſelves, as tended to the correction of vice, except life and limb.</note> ſomthing to vary the form of their ſynagogues-diſcipline, becauſe they had no <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Courts in thoſe Heathen Countries to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon: therefore in thoſe Countries the Elders of each ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue did keep a Court or Conſiſtory in each ſynagogue for the correction of manners; and this power of Diſcipline was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to them by the conſent and approbation of their Heathen Governours. I ſay, the Elders of each ſynagogue had this power of diſcipline, as it is evident; becauſe the <hi>high Prieſts did ſend</hi> Paul <hi>with letters unto the Elders of every Synagogue, to impriſon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd to beat ſuch in every Synagogue, as embraced the holy waies of the Lord</hi> Jeſus: they had ſome power to inflict ſome kind of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment, as well as power to excommunicate<hi>:</hi> and in ſome caſes they did good juſtice againſt ſome ſins, which elſe would have eſcaped unpuniſhed; as ſwearing, curſing, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, fornication, inceſt, and ſuch like ſins, which heathen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates would have paſſed over lightly. But the Elders of each ſynagogue had power to puniſh theſe and the like ſins, provided they did not take away life or limb: for this was the onely Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of Heathen Courts in every Countrey where they lived in diſperſion. And it is further evident, that the Elders of each ſynagogue did exerciſe ſome power of diſcipline even in <hi>Canaan</hi> it ſelf, after they became ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Juriſdiction, which no doubt was allowed them by their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Courts alſo; for in thoſe daies they did inflict ſcourging upon offenders as often as there was juſt cauſe, as theſe places do teſtifie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 34. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 22. and 12. 11. and 21. 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 19. and 26. 11. and ſomtimes they did alſo excommunicate, by putting evil perſons out of their Communion for a time, namely, as long as they were incorrigible and impenitent: as theſe places do teſtifie. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 22. 34. and 12. 42. and 16. 2.</p>
                  <p>And godly reaſon and wiſdom did neceſſitate the diſperſed Jews to uſe this Independent power of Diſcipline, when they were firſt diſperſed into heathen Countries, for many godly Jews were forced to fly for ſafety into many heathen Countries, even in the daies of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> for he preached 40. yeers together that the land ſhould be made deſolate by the Tyrannie of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar;</hi> thereupon many godly Jews took the warning, and fled away as they could get opportunity before the captivity, for their better liberty and ſafety: the believing Jews ſold their lands

and means, though with ſome reluctation, and others bought with great content. But <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let not the ſeller mourn, nor the buyer rejoyce,</hi> Ezek. 7. 12. Our caſe for <hi>New-England</hi> was much like theirs.</p>
                  <p>And whereſoever theſe godly Jews came, they had liberty to build ſynagogues for the exerciſe of Religion, as theſe Scriptures compared together do teſtifie, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 16. and 6. 8, 9. and 11. 16. and 12. 16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Eſt.</hi> 3. 10. And it ſeems the bleſſing of God was much upon the poſterity of theſe diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jews<hi>:</hi> For <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> wrote ſeveral Epiſtles to them, with ſundry heathen Proſelytes that were conjoyned in the profeſſion of the ſame Faith, and <hi>Paul</hi> doth teſtifie that there were many <hi>(Myriads,</hi> that is,) ten thouſands diſperſed Iews that did believe in Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 10.</p>
                  <p>And I make no queſtion, but as theſe diſperſed Iews found fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with their heathen governours to build ſynagogues in every heathen Countrey where they came, ſo alſo they found the like favour to ſet up ſuch a form of Diſcipline in each ſynagogue, as might tend to the preſervation of their Religion, by cenſuring ſcandalous and impenitent Perſons according to their demerits, provided they did not take away life or limb.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, it is evident they had this power of Government with the conſent of their heathen Governours; For <hi>Gallio</hi> the Deputy of <hi>Achaia</hi> doth teſtifie, that the Iews of that Countrey had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain power of Government among themſelves: for <hi>Gallio</hi> doth thus anſwer the Iews that accuſed <hi>Paul</hi> of falſe Doctrine. <hi>If it were a matter of wrong, or an evil deed, O ye Iews, I would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reaſon maintain you. But ſeing it is about a queſtion of words and names of your Law; look ye to it your ſelves:</hi> Acts 18. <hi>For you have a power of Government among your ſelves, in ſuch like caſes as this is, whereof you do accuſe</hi> Paul, <hi>therefore I will be no judge of theſe things: and ſo he drave them from the Iudgment ſeat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And other Heathen Governours did acknowledge alſo that the Iews had a certain power of government among themſelves in all matters that concerned the preſervation of their Religion; as it is evident by <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 29. and 25. 19.</p>
                  <p>Yea <hi>Haman</hi> by way of accuſation did affirm to <hi>Ahaſuerus, That there was a people ſcattered abroad among his people in</hi> 127. <hi>Provinces, that had Laws divers from all his People:</hi> Eſth. 3. 8.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118698:25"/>
Now it may be demanded what Lawes had they divers from all other people? Did not they live according to the Laws of the Empire? Yea doubtleſs<hi>:</hi> but they had an order of Diſcipline which the Elders of each Synagogue did exerciſe upon ſuch as did not live according to Gods Laws: and in this reſpect the Iews had Laws differing from all other Nations.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon doth tell all reaſonable men, that in what Countrey ſoever heathen Governours did allow the Jews ſo much liberty as to build ſynagogues for the worſhip of their God, they would doubtles allow them ſo much power of Diſcipline alſo, as did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily appertain to the preſervation of that worſhip<hi>:</hi> and the Scripture doth tell us, that as long as they might lawfully make Judges of their own, it was not lawful for them to plead before Infidels; I mean in ſuch caſes wherein they had power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>vid. Ainſw.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>By theſe conſiderations it is evident, that the Jews had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent power of Diſcipline in each ſynagogue, as long as they lived in heathen Countries.</p>
                  <p>Now in the ſecond place, I think it neceſſary alſo to ſpeak a little more fully of their ſynagogue Diſcipline, as it was Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon the Elders of the general Church while they lived in <note place="margin">Their ſynagogue Diſcipline was Dependent as long as they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Canaan.</note> 
                     <hi>Canaan.</hi> I mean before their diſperſion into heathen Countries. But before my meaning can be well diſcerned, I muſt firſt explain the nature and conſtitution of their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> government.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> government was twice ordained. 1. By the adviſe of <hi>Iethro:</hi> and 2. By the immediate direction of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Gods preſence. Firſt, I ſay, that <hi>Iethro</hi> by the light of true <note place="margin">When the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was firſt ordained.</note> reaſon, did adviſe <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſet up this form of true government, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. But ſecondly, afterwards the Angel of the Covenant himſelf, did ordain this form of Government<hi>:</hi> and therefore he appointed <hi>Moſes</hi> to make a new choiſe of Elders of the beſt and ableſt that were among them; and for this purpoſe the <hi>Angel</hi> (that gave <hi>Moſes</hi> lively Oracles) appointed <hi>Moſes</hi> to gather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him 70. men: <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as the people had before choſen, and approved to be their Elders<hi>:</hi> and they muſt be ſuch alſo as <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf knew to be men of approved wiſdom and godlines, and then the Son of God (to whom the father committed all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power as Mediator) ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, I will come down and ſpeak with thee there, and I will take off the Spirit which is upon thee, and put it upon them, and they ſhall bear with thee the burden of the people.</hi> Num. 11. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:118698:26"/>
In theſe words are laid down the original ground of ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſtituting the chief Court of their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe one Court could not conveniently ſerve for the daily uſe of all parts of the Land. Therefore the Son of God to <note place="margin">Ieſus Chriſt did firſt conſtitute the Sanhedrin government.</note> whom was given all power and authority, directed <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> to make and conſtitute as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Courts as they ſhould have Cities in their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when they came into the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> In <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 10. Thus it is expreſſed; <hi>Iudges and Officers ſhalt thou make thee in all thy gates which</hi> Jehovah <hi>thy God giveth thee through all thy Tribes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Judges, that is to ſay, Elders ſiting in the ſeat of Iudicature<hi>:</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are ſuch as attend upon the Iudges to execute their commands. <hi>Shalt thou make thee,</hi> that is to ſay, thou that art the high <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin,</hi> thou ſhalt make and conſtitute Iudges in all thy gates, both in the greater Cities, and leſſer Towns within the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> But thou art not bound hereby to conſtitute <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Courts out of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> for it is ſaid <hi>in all thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Chriſt</hi> do command the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> to ſet up ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Courts of Iudicature in every Citie, yet he doth not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the number of Iudges how many ſhall belong to each Court, but he leaves that to be ordred by the wiſdom of the high <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> becauſe they were the chief choſen Elders of the whole Church<hi>:</hi> and they ſaw it neceſſary to ordain two degrees of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin</hi> Courts mo, which they ſet up aſſoon as they were ſetled in the land, in every Citie and Town, for the more convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of Iuſtice through all the parts of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not only within, but alſo without <hi>Iordan</hi> in the Tribes of <hi>Ruben, Gad,</hi> and half <hi>Manaſſes:</hi> reſerving onely to themſelves ſuch caſes as were too difficult for the leſſer Courts. And thus was the diſpoſition of their Courts according to the expoſition of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Doctors.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The higheſt <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> conſiſted of 70. Iudges and one, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 16, 17. 30. where Chriſt joyned 70. Elders unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> the King. For <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to be a King in <hi>Ieſurun,</hi> Deut. 33. 5. and in imitation thereof, they did ever after account their kings to be the head of the high <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> and at laſt this high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> was ſetled at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:118698:26"/>
Secondly, This high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> erected two other <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Courts in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> each of them conſiſting of twenty three Iudges a piece<hi>:</hi> one of them ſate in the mountain of the Temple, and the other ſate at the dore of the Court-yard of the Temple<hi>:</hi> and the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> ſate in the chamber of hewen ſtone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They appointed and ordained another <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> of twenty three Iudges in every Citie of Iſrael, if there were in it but an hundred and twenty men: And they kept their Courts in the gates of the Citie. <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 15.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They ſet up alſo a Court of three Iudges in every Town and Citie, wherein were leſs then an hundred and twenty men; and they ordained that no Court ſhould be kept of any leſs then three choſen Elders<hi>:</hi> they ordained alſo that every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which had not in it two wiſe men, the one fit to teach the whole Law, and the other skilful to hear, and to demand, and to make anſwer; that no <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> ſhould be ſet therein, although it had in it two thouſand Iſraelites. <hi>Vid.

                  <p>By theſe concluſions we may ſee what great care the Hebrew Doctors took for the well ordering not only of the higheſt, but of the loweſt <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> alſo, with learned and skilful Elders.</p>
                  <p>And the Hebrew Doctors ſay, that the Elders of the loweſt <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> (which they call the Court of three men) muſt have every one of them theſe ſeven properties, Firſt, Wiſdom. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Meekneſs. Thirdly, The fear of God. Fourthly, the hatred of <hi>Mammon.</hi> Fifthly, Love of Truth. Sixthly.

                  <p>Moreover, the Elders of this <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> of three, had great honor<hi>: Vide Ainſ, in Deut.</hi> 22. 15. They were called <hi>Elohim,</hi> Gods, as well as the Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> becauſe the word of God was given to all the Elders in general, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 9. 13. 14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 23. with <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 34, 35. The Hebrew Doctors ſay, that none are called <hi>Elohim,</hi> but thoſe Judges which were ordained in the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely, and ſuch as are wiſe and fit to judge, and ſuch as the Senate of the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſought out, appointed and impoſed hands upon them. <hi>Ainſ. on Exod.</hi> 21. 6.</p>

                  <p>But notwithſtanding, their godly care touching Courts and Elders which they ſet up in all parts of the land for the well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Religion and Juſtice, yet the Devil and mans corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion quickly found out deviſes to corrupt theſe Fountains of good government; and aſſoon as the fountains of good government were corrupt, the leſſer riverets, I mean their Synagogue govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt needs be corrupt alſo. But ever and anon God raiſed up freſh means of reformation.</p>
                  <p>Corruption in government was increaſed by <hi>Samuels</hi> ſonnes, and more by <hi>Saul;</hi> but after ſome ſpace of time, God raiſed up <hi>David, A man after his own heart to feed his people</hi> Iſrael <hi>with Iuſtice and judgement.</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 7. 8. Pſal. 78. 70. In thoſe dayes godly <hi>David</hi> took care to furniſh all theſe Courts with wiſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, out of all Tribes, and ſome of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> were conjoyned with them<hi>:</hi> For he appointed <hi>Chonaniah,</hi> and his ſons of the <hi>Icharites</hi> for the buſineſſes without (that is to ſay, remote from <hi>Jeruſalem)</hi> for Officers and Judges: and of the <hi>Hebronites,</hi> he appointed <hi>Haſhaviah</hi> and his brethren which were men of activity ſeventeen thouſand over the charge of them of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Iordan</hi> weſtward in all buſineſſes of the Lord, and in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the King. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 29, 30.

Verſe 31, 32. Many Rulers were needfull in ſuch a time of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118698:27"/>
Reformation, but it is worth the marking, that all theſe chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were appointed to look to every matter appertaining to God, as well as to the things of the King.</p>
                  <p>But after ſome ſpace of time theſe <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> courts were again corrupted, and good <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> did again reforme them<hi>:</hi> firſt he ſent abroad divers of his Princes as well as <hi>Levits,</hi> to inſtruct the people in the knowledge of Gods Law, in all the Cities and ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of <hi>Iudah,</hi> 2 Chron. 17. 7. Thoſe Princes were learned and therefore were not aſhamed to expound the Law of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent unto the people for that purpoſe: hence I gather that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prince of any Tribe, having a fair calling, by the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> might as lawfully preach in any ſynagogue of the Jews, as <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Benjamin</hi> might, or as the Apoſtles of <hi>Iudah</hi> might. But this example ought not to be imitated by ſuch as want an outward calling, or that want learned abilities.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> proſecuted this new-begun Reformation, by reſtoring the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> courts to their original puritie. Firſt, He reformed thoſe Courts that conſiſted of three and twenty Judges in all the ſtrong Cities of <hi>Iuda,</hi> Citie by Citie, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 5. 2. He reformed the high Sanhedrin of ſeventy Judges, ſetting up ſome Levits, ſome Prieſts, and ſome of the chief families of Iſrael, for the Judgements and Cauſe of the Lord, 1 Chron. 19. 8.</p>
                  <p>The Rulers of Iſrael did not take themſelves neceſſarily tyed to ſet up ſome Levits among the Elders of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For the Hebrew Doctors ſay, that this high Sanhedrin might be all of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though uſually they adjoyned ſome of <hi>Levi</hi> to them, <hi>Aaron</hi> was joyned to <hi>Moſes</hi> the King, in the firſt election, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. afterwards <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo did appoint ſome Prieſts and Levits, to ſit with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judges of the other Tribes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 9, to 14. and <hi>Aaron</hi> was joyned with <hi>Hur,</hi> among the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai, Exod.</hi> 24. 14.</p>
                  <p>After the captivitie <hi>Ezra</hi> alſo did obtain ſo much favour of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Princes, that he reſtored this government again to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie thereof, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 25, 26. with ch. 10. 14.</p>
                  <p>But in proceſſe of time, when the Romane Emperours were Lords over the Jewes, then they took away from them the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of life and death, about a yeare or two before the death of Chriſt: For <hi>Talmud Ieruſalemi,</hi> and <hi>Maymony</hi> in <hi>San.</hi> do ſhew that 48. yeers before the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> cauſes of life
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118698:28"/>
and death were taken away from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and this Teſtimony is confirmed by the Jews own confeſſion to <hi>Pilate,</hi> for they told <hi>Pilate,</hi> that <hi>it was not lawful for them to put any man to death: Ioh.</hi> 18. 31. and this was brought to paſſe before the death of Chriſt, by Gods ſpecial providence; that the words of Chriſt might be fulfilled, when he fore-told the <hi>manner of his death, that it ſhould not be after the Iewiſh but after the Romane manner, Ioh.</hi> 12. 32. 33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 19.</p>
                  <p>And yet, though the Romans took away the power of life and death, from the Jewes they did not take away all power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from the Jews, but they ſtill left them to exerciſe the power of their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Courts in all other caſes, as <hi>Pilats</hi> ſpeech to the Scribes and Phariſees doth import, when he bade them <hi>take Chriſt and judge him according to their own Law, Ioh.</hi> 18. 31. * And our Saviour taught the Jews to <hi>Hear,</hi> that is to ſay, <note place="margin">To ſit in <hi>Moſes chair</hi> is to iudge according to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Lawes.</note>

Therefore the Jews did exerciſe the power of Government, in their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Courts, except in the caſe of life and death, when the Romans had taken away from them the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of life and death.</p>

                     <hi>You ſaid ere-while. that the Elders of the Sanhedrin, were the Elders of the Church. But how doe you prove that the Elders of the High Sanhedrin were the general Elders of the whole Church, in all matters of Religion, as well as in matters of the Common weal?</hi>

                  <speaker>Teacher,</speaker>
                  <p>I have already proved that Chriſt did put this power into their hands. 1. They are plainly called the Elders of the Church, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. 14, 15. 2. It is evident that every Elder of the chief <hi>Synedrion,</hi> was choſen to be a general Elder of the whole Church. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 25. 30. And the Elders of this high <hi>Synedri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſet up other Courts and other Elders in every Citie, who judged in all matters of Religion that fell out in their reſpective parts, as <note place="margin">The Elders of the Sanhedrin were the general Elders of the Church, and therefore they had power to deal in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion as well as in civil cauſes.</note> well as in civil matters, except the matter were too hard for them, and then in ſuch caſes <hi>Moſes</hi> ordained before-hand, that all ſuch hard matters ſhould be brought in an orderly way unto the high <hi>Synedrion,</hi> (which was ſetled afterwards at <hi>Ieruſalem.)</hi> And this orderly way of bringing the difficult cauſes before them, is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Hebrew Doctors, as you may ſee it ſet down by Mr <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> chap. 17. 9.</p>
                  <p>3. It is evident that the Elders of the high <hi>Synedrion</hi> were the general Elders of the Church, becauſe they were ordained to bee Judges, not only in civil Cauſes, but alſo in Levitical matters, as theſe places well examined doe fully teſtifie. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 12. and 21. 2. 19, 20. and 22. 15. to 19. and 25. 7, 8, 9. and 27. 1. and 29. 10. and 31. 9. And the <hi>Angel-Iehovah,</hi> Chriſt, (1 Cor. 10.) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Moſes</hi> the Magiſtrate, as well as <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt, to inſtruct the people in all his Levitical Laws, <hi>Speak ye to all the people of Iſrael, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>Teach them to obſerve all my Levitical Laws,</hi> Levit. 11. 2. Hence it is evident, that if any queſtion did ariſe about the practiſe of the Levitical Lawes, that <hi>Moſes</hi> the chief Magiſtrate, (as he was the Head of the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin)</hi> muſt expound the true ſenſe and meaning of ſuch Lawes, both to the Levits and people<hi>:</hi> and in caſe any did walk contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Teaching, they might correct and puniſh them: as for example, There were certain men, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean by a dead corps.</hi> In this caſe they could not tell whether they might come to that ſecond Paſſeover, yea or no. Therefore thoſe men brought the matter before <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as before <hi>Aaron,</hi> as they were the chief Heads of the <hi>Synedrion.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118698:29"/>
unto them in verſ. 8. <hi>Stand ſtill, and I will hear what Iehovah will command concerning you.</hi> This deliberate enquiry of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> into this difficult matter, may teach the Elders of any Church or Common Weal, not to paſſe ſentence too haſtily in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſes, till they have a word from Chriſt, to warrant their judgement.</p>
                  <p>4. It is alſo evident that all the Iudges of the <hi>Synedrion</hi> had need to be wiſe, and learned in the wiſdom of the Law, becauſe they muſt give judgement, and paſſe their ſentence in all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and difficult caſes; yea even in doubtful Levitical caſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mamony</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the Elders of the great Sanhedrin were wont to ſit in the Temple to judge and try the Prieſts, both touching their Genealogies, and Blemiſhes: and what Prieſt ſoever they found diſ-allowable by his Genealogie, they clothed him in black; and ſo he went out of the Prieſts Court in the Temple. But whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they found perfect and fit, he was clothed in white, and went in, and miniſtred with his brethren.</hi> Ainſwoth in his Preface to <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all theſe teſtimonies we may ſee that the Iudges of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrion Court</hi> were the general Elders of the Church, to look to all matters, as well Levitical as Civil.</p>
                  <p>Yea, ſometimes the Prieſts were ſo ſimple in the knowledge of their duty, that the Iudges of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> were fain to teach them their duty. As for example, If the Prieſts were unclean or unmeet any kinde of way to burn the <hi>Red heifer,</hi> then it was the proper duty of the Iudges of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> to looke to this matter<hi>:</hi> they muſt take abundant care to ſee it done, as it ought to be done. <hi>Ainſ. Numb.</hi> 10. 7.</p>
                  <p>It belonged alſo to the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> to judge in all Levitical Ordinances, both of <hi>Prohibition,</hi> and <hi>Permiſſion:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Clean,</hi> and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean,</hi> and in all like caſes. <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 2. and it belonged to them to judge in all caſes about tythes: <hi>Ainſ.</hi> Levit. 27. 33.</p>
                  <p>And if a Prieſt were not able to judge of the ſignes of the plague of Leproſie, then it was not lawful for ſuch a Prieſt to look upon any Plague, till a Maſter had taught him, and made him expert in all Plagues. <hi>Ainſ. Levit.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing the Elders of the <hi>Synedrion</hi> muſt judge in all ſuch like Levitical caſes as this<hi>:</hi> it follows by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that they were the general Elders of the whole Church: and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118698:29"/>
therefore they had power to inflict the ſentence of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation upon any offender, as well as other puniſhments<hi>:</hi> For they judged in all caſes; as well in matters of Religion, as civil Juſtice<hi>:</hi> and therefore alſo by the ſame rule of equity, the Judges of the higheſt Court, now may <hi>diſpence</hi> the ſame power now; both they and their Subſtitutes<hi>:</hi> provided they take the like care that none be made Judges, but ſuch as be learned and godly.</p>

                     <hi>You ſaid ere while, that Ieſus Chriſt put</hi> Aaron <hi>the high Prieſt in truſt with the care of matters of Religion, as wel as</hi> Moſes <hi>the King. In that reſpect, I conceive that the high Prieſt was the principal Elder of the National Church: If ſo, then it belonged to him, as the chief Elder of the Church, to diſpence all actions of Church-diſcipline, and ſo many learned do conclude and affirm.</hi>

                  <p>I grant that many learned Divines do uſually ſay and affirm, that the high Prieſt was the chief Elder of that national Church; and thus <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in <hi>Photius</hi> Library doth make the high Prieſt the ſtay of the State.</p>
                  <p>But I Anſwer firſt Negatively; <hi>That the high Sacrificer was</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The high Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer was not the chief Elder of the National Church in Iſrael, as ſome affirm.</note> 
                     <hi>many times ſo ſimple, that he was not fit to be choſen for an Elder of the</hi> Sanhedrin, <hi>and therefore not fit to be the chief Elder of the whole Church.</hi> But ſecondly, <hi>I ſay, that if the high Sacrificer were at any time choſen to be one of the Elders of the</hi> Synedrion, <hi>then by that choice he was made an Elder of the National Church, or elſe not: His Prieſtly Office did not make him an Elder of the high</hi> Sanhedrin <hi>(or</hi> Synedrion) <hi>unleſſe he were choſen thereto in an orderly way, as all the other Iudges of that Court were.</hi> But, <hi>If he were orderly choſen to be one of the Iudges of the</hi> Sanhedrin, <hi>then if his gifts and parts were more eminent then others, he might haply be more exerciſed in judging Levitical Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances then others. But if his parts were leſſe eminent then ſome other Iudges of the</hi> Sanhedrin, <hi>then other Iudges choſen out of their Tribes might be more exerciſed in judging Levitical Laws and Ordinances then he, and ſo they might be preferred above him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It is evident, that the high Sacrificer was not the chief Elder of the Church, as he was the high Prieſt: for though he had a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge above all other Prieſts, in the Prieſts Office, yet he had no place among the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> as he was the high Prieſt<hi>:</hi> For his high Prieſts Office fell to him partly by birth (which hath no learning nor gifts intailed to it) and partly he was choſen
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118698:30"/>
by the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrin. They anointed the high Prieſt, and inſtalled him into his Office, becauſe they were the Churches Elders.</hi> Ainſ. Levit. 6. 20.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Talmud Ieruſalemi</hi> in <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> ſheweth that the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> might be all of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> without any one of <hi>Levi:</hi> and that the high Prieſt was not of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin,</hi> except he were rarely learned and ſage: but ſaith the <hi>Talmud,</hi> they were often times ſo ſimple, that the Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> were forced to teach them their duty on Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion day: And this the Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> did not as a voluntary act, but as a duty commanded them by vertue of their Office, as they were the Churches Elders. For <hi>it was the Angel of Gods preſence that commanded</hi> Moſes <hi>the Magiſtrate (or head Elder of the</hi> Sanhedrin) <hi>to ſpeak unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>the high Prieſt (after the death of</hi> Aarons <hi>two ſons by fire) for their tranſgreſſion) to warn him of his duty on Expiation day, leſt he might tranſgreſs in his duty, as his ſonnes had done. vide</hi> Ainſ. on Levit. 16. 1, 2. 33.</p>
                  <p>And as the Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> muſt anoint the high Prieſt, and inſtal him into his office<hi>:</hi> ſo alſo they might excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him for his offences, as the Hebrew Doctors do teſtifie, they ſay they might not excommunicate the King (except in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> caſe) but in great offence the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> would ſay unto the King; <hi>Keep your houſe (for a time) and ſalve your honour. v.

Yea, the <hi>Talmud</hi> in <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> ſheweth that the high Prieſt was judged in all ſorts as any other man<hi>:</hi> Therefore the high Prieſt was not by the vertue of his high Prieſts Office the chief Elder of the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church. But the Judges of the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> (whereof the King was the head) were the chief Elders of the National Church. They had the charge, and the burden laid upon them to deal in all Levitical controverſies as well as in matters of civil juſtice<hi>:</hi> for as it was the Angel <hi>(Acts</hi> 7.) that gave <hi>Moſes</hi> lively Oracles) that ſaid unto <hi>Moſes</hi> the King, as well as unto <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt, (as they were chief perſons in the high <hi>Sanhedrin)</hi> that he ſhould inſtruct the people in the obſervation of all Levitical Ordinances. <hi>Levit.</hi> 11. 2. and ſo on as it follows in the next Chapter, as I have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118698:30"/>
noted above. 2. It was <hi>Moſes</hi> the King, as well as <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt, that charged all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to obſerve holy convocations every Sabbath in all their dwellings. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 3. Chriſt commanded them to charge the people to obſerve the Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>3. It was the Angel that had the Name of God in him, that firſt ordained the Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> as the general El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church in all matters of Religion, as well as in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of civil Juſtice<hi>:</hi> they muſt regain people from Apoſtacie. Therefore <hi>Iehovah</hi> the Mediator (to whom the Father hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all authority and power) ſaid to the Judges of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin: Hear I pray you, O ye heads of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ye Princes of the houſe of Iſrael, ſhould not ye know judgement?</hi> Mica. 3. 1. As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, none ought to be Iudges of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> but wiſe and godly men, ſuch as are able to judge and trie cauſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, according to all the Ordinances of <hi>Moſes.</hi> We may take <hi>Iehoſophats</hi> example for a Lanthorn to our feet in this caſe<hi>:</hi> He charged the Iudges to try all matters of Religion, as well as civil affairs. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. But how could they be competent Iudges, except they were learned in the Levitical Laws, as well as in the Iudicials. This ſhews what care ought to be taken in all thoſe whom it concerns, to ſeek out for the ableſt men that can be found for Elders and Iudges, for variety of great and difficult matters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to their judgement. <hi>Vide Anſ.</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 15. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 2.</p>
                  <p>4. It is evident that the Iudges of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> were the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Elders of the whole Church: becauſe the Sin-offering of the whole Church was preſented to the Lord by their hands. For if the whole Church did ſinne ignorantly in their practiſe againſt any branch of the Law of God through the erroneous teaching of the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> then as ſoon as this ſinfull practiſe was found out by any man of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Church muſt bring a bullock for a ſin-offering, and yet the whole Church of people were not bound to come to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to offer this general Church ſinne-offering. But the whole Church did it, (being abſent) by their Elders onely, namely by the Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi> Yet ſtill the queſtion will be, who among them was the Churches chief Elder in this action. The anſwer is, <hi>Not the high Prieſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were one of their Elders choſen to be of the</hi> Sanhedrin. <hi>But the Elders of the</hi> Sanhedrin <hi>Court in general, or any three of them, did bring this bullock as they were the Churches Elders,</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:118698:31"/>
                     <hi>they laid their hand upon the head of the ſaid Bullock, in the name of the whole Church, whoſe ſin-offering it was.</hi> verſe 14. 21. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> might be called the Church, for they were the whole Church repreſentatively. But after the Churches Elders had thus preſented the ſaid Bullock for the ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering of the whole Church; it belonged to the high Priect (as he was the chief anointed Prieſt) to kill the ſaid Bullock before <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah. Ainſ. Levit</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows that the Judges of the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Court were the General Elders of the whole Church: and this thing is put out of doubt, becauſe they are plainly called the Elders of the whole Congregation, in <hi>v.</hi> 15. This is ſo plain, that nothing can be plainer ſpoken: and ſo in like ſort the Elders of all the other <hi>Sanhedrins</hi> (being many thouſands in all) were to be accounted as the Elders of the Church alſo, in all the parts of Canaan, in their reſpective Tribes; they muſt bear the burden with the high <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin</hi> as their <hi>Delegates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And when the Churches ſin-offering was to be offered, <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Prieſt, as he was an Elder of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> muſt ſpeak to the ſons of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bring it, namely he muſt ſpeak to the chief ſons of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which were the Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Court to bring it. <hi>vide Ainſ. Levit.</hi> 9. 3. For theſe Elders were the higheſt Officers that the Church had. And therefore the term <hi>Elder,</hi> is a ſuperior Title to the term <hi>Biſhop:</hi> For the term <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> is given to thoſe inſerior Officers that attended upon the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Court, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet an Apoſtate Prieſt might be a Biſhop after his repentance, but he might not be an Elder of the <hi>Sanhedrin:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might he be reſtored to be a full Prieſt any more, but he might ſerve as a Biſhop in a place of inferiority in the Temple. <hi>Ainſ.

                  <p>I make no queſtion but <hi>Iehovah</hi> the <hi>Mediator,</hi> from <hi>Iehovah,</hi> gave them all power that was ſutable to the well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Church, from the very firſt time that he ordained them to be the general <hi>Elders</hi> of his Church in the wilderneſs: therefore <note place="margin">Chriſt gave them power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication originally to the Elders of the Sanhedrin in the wildernes.</note> he did then give the power of excommunication into their hands; and though it be not in plain terms expreſſed, yet it is implyed by neceſſary conſequence, becauſe he gave them power to correct all vice and ſin, with ſutable puniſhments, as I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſeeing that power of Excommunication was given by Chriſt originally to the Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> in the Wildernes, it muſt belong alſo to the Elders of all the other <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrins</hi> in their reſpective places, becauſe they had their power of Delegation from them, yet by Chriſts ordinance, as above, and ſo in time it went from them to the Elders of each particular ſynagogue alſo, eſpecially when they lived in diſperſed places in ſeveral heathen Countries, Yea the power of Excommunication was practiſed in the ſynagogues of <hi>Canaan,</hi> at leaſt after the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, if not before.</p>

                     <hi>Some learned men do think, that Excommunication came not into practiſe among the</hi> Jews, <hi>until the</hi> Romans <hi>had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the power of life and death from the Elders of the</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin, <hi>and that thereupon the Elders of the</hi> Sanhedrin <hi>were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to invent the uſe of excommunication as a capital puniſhment for capital offenders, next unto death: and thereupon they think that ſeing the Elders of the Church of</hi> Corinth <hi>could not put the Inceſtuous perſon to death, as</hi> Moſes <hi>Law did appoint,</hi> Levit. 20. <hi>they did excommunicate him out of the Church, as the next pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment unto death.</hi>

                  <p>I grant that the <hi>Romans</hi> had taken away the power of life and death from the <hi>Sanhedrin-Court</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> about a yeer or two before the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as I have formerly noted: and therefore the Elders of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> could much leſs put him to death; neither ought Excommunication to be accounted
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118698:32"/>
as the greateſt puniſhment next death. Neither do I agree to thoſe that ſay, that <hi>Excommunication was not in practiſe among the</hi> Jews, <hi>until that time when the</hi> Romans <hi>took away the power of life and death from them.</hi> I do not think that the Elders of the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> at this time (being moſt of them degenerate, <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees)</hi> would now firſt have invented ſuch a religious courſe of Juſtice, as Excommunication rightly uſed is: I rather think that Excommunication was in practiſe among the Jews, in the daies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or at leaſt, long before the daies of <hi>Ezra.</hi> And my reaſons are theſe<hi>:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is evident that the Son of God did endow the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> in the Wildernes, with full power and authority to ordain ſuch Laws as might tend to the ſuppreſſion and Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſcandalous ſins; and therefore they had power to ordain a Law for Excommunication, if they ſaw it needful; as I noted before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore they did ordain Excommunication, or ſome other Act of Juſtice in the place of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Hebrew Doctors <hi>in Sannedrin</hi> ſay, <hi>No King ought to be excommunicate, except in</hi> Jeroboams <hi>caſe:</hi> but they ſay, <hi>That for his great offences, the Elders of the Synedrion did warn him to keep his Houſe for a time, to ſalve his honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence I reaſon thus, that this rule of Excommunication which is given by the Hebrew Doctors, muſt have relation to thoſe times when Kings reigned among them. But the whole race of Kings was ended before the daies of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and no more Kings were ſuffered to reign afterwards. For <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the Doctors of his age, knew well enough that they ſhould have no more Kings till Chriſt came<hi>:</hi> They knew well enough from the Propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that <hi>the four great Beaſts would take away the Kingdom of the Saints of the Moſt High.</hi> Dan. 7. 18. Therefore he and the Doctors of his age would never have given this rule to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the King from Excommunication, in relation to ſucceeding times, and therefore they gave this rule to be obſerved in the daies of Kings at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I conceive that Excommunication was in practiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the daies of <hi>Ezra;</hi> becauſe elſe I cannot ſee how the godly Jews that were diſperſed into ſundry heathen Countries, where they built ſynagogues for the exerciſe of their Religion, could poſſibly preſerve their Religion in purity, and from ſcandal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe and practiſe of Excommunication in their ſynagogues.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118698:32"/>
And the ſcattered Jews very hardly could have agreed upon ſuch a practiſe univerſally, except they had known the uſe of it among the Jews, before the Captivity.</p>
                  <p>And it is evident that the Jews did univerſally practiſe Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in their ſynagogues in all heathen Countries, by the complaint that <hi>Haman</hi> the <hi>Amalekite</hi> made to <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> againſt the Jews that were ſcattered into the hundred twenty and ſeven Provinces of his Dominion<hi>:</hi> He told the King, <hi>That their Laws were divers from all people, and that they did not obſerve the Kings Laws:</hi> Eſth. 3. 8. This differing Form of Laws from all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cannot be underſtood of any other Laws or Government, but ſuch as the Jews did practiſe in their ſynagogues: I grant they expounded the Law of God in their ſynagogues, but they could not correct incorrigible and ſcandalous perſons, without ſome form of Laws to ſtrengthen their Diſcipline, therefore in reaſon they could not be without the uſe and practiſe of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all their ſynagogues; And it was foretold that they ſhould not be reckoned among the Nations, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 9. becauſe they ſhould have certain Laws diſtinct by themſelves.</p>

                     <hi>In what caſes did the Elders of the</hi> Sanhedrin <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate?

And did they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate for ſins againſt God, as well as for ſins againſt Man?</hi>

                  <p>I cannot as yet find in the Hebrew Doctors for what particular ſins they did excommunicate<hi>:</hi> but by collection, I find that they did excommunicate for ſins againſt the firſt Table, as <note place="margin">In what caſes the Elders of the Sanhedrin did excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</note> well as for ſins againſt the ſecond Table, and for ſins of Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſomtimes: though moſt uſually for ſcandalous ſins againſt a prohibition. But for ſins of treſpaſs againſt a mans neighbour, they did ordinarily puniſh ſuch ſins, by impoſing upon them ſome kind of ſatisfaction by their goods, rather then by Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>I find one inſtance in the Hebrew Doctors for Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a ſin againſt a prohibition of the firſt Table. The caſe is this. Whoſoever did any ſerviſe work in the Paſs-over evening, from mid-day, and forwards, he was to be ſcourged, or excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the <hi>Niddui,</hi> that is to ſay, with the leſſer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. But they did not ſcourge or excommunicate for working in the Evening of their Feſtival Sabbaths, nor yet for working in the Evening of the Sabbath or ſeventh day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118698:33"/>
the evening before the ſabbath (which by their Ceremonial anti-date they called the evening of the ſabbath) was not any part of the ſabbath it ſelf, it was but for preparation to the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. But the evening of the Paſs-over from mid-day and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, was the very day of the Paſs-over it ſelf, for the Paſs-over evening began at mid-day, and ended at midnight. The words of <hi>Maymony</hi> run thus, <hi>It is unlawful to do works in the Evenings of the Festival daies (from the time of Evening Sacrifice, and forwards,) even as on the Evenings of the Sabbaths: and who ſo doth work in them, ſhall never ſee a ſigne of bleſſing, and he is to be rebuked, and to be made to leave off by force, though he is not for it to be ſcourged or excommunicate, except in the Evening of the Paſsover, after Mid-day: who ſo doth work therein after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, is to be ſcourged, or excommunicate with the</hi> Niddui, <hi>if he be not ſcourged. For the fourteenth of</hi> Niſan <hi>is not like unto other Feſtivals, becauſe in it are the feast and the killing of Sacrifices: See</hi> Ainſ. <hi>in</hi> Lev. 23. 5. Hence I gather alſo, that they uſed to excommunicate men for ſuch ſins as deſerved ſcourging<hi>:</hi> they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſcourging or excommunication as an indifferent puniſhment for the ſame ſin, as the circumſtances of time, place, perſon, and the like, did ſway with them.</p>

                  <p>The Hebrew Doctors do reckon up the ſeveral ſorts of ſins that deſerved beating to be 207. <hi>Ainſw.</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 2. and for the moſt of theſe ſins, I conceive that excommunication was as ſutable as whipping. But for ſome ſins of treſpaſſes, if <hi>the ſinner did confeſs and repent,</hi> then he was appointed to <hi>bring his Sacrifice of Atonement,</hi> Numb. 5. 7. and then he was free from any further puniſhment<hi>:</hi> But for ſome kind of ſins he was not only to bring his ſacrifice of Atonement, but he muſt be beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en alſo; as for example, He that ſweareth vainly or falſly, was both to be beaten by the Magiſtrate, and he muſt bring his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of atonement alſo. <hi>Vid. Ainſw.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 12. and 5. 4. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 7. But the moſt ordinary puniſhment of leſſer capital ſins, was done by ſcourging. They whipped the High Prieſt for marrying a Widow, as I noted before: and they whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other Prieſts for ſeveral ſinful failings in the execution of their Office; as for example, in omiting a duty of the firſt Table<hi>:</hi> If
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118698:33"/>
the Prieſt did not divide the poor mans Treſpaſſe-offering with his nail aright, he was to be puniſhed by beating. <hi>vid. Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 8. and in ſuch like caſes as this, they whipped a Prieſt rather then Excommunicate him, becauſe the Prieſts were bound to wait upon the ſervice of the Sanctuary, therefore they might not be Excommunicated, leſt it ſhould diſ-able them for their ſervice in the Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>I conceive that the ſin of Impenitency after admonition was the chief cauſe of Excommunication: for if a Jew met an Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate perſon in the Temple, he would thus ſalute him<hi>: He that dwelleth in this Houſe, give into thy heart that thou maieſt hearken to the words of thy neighbour:</hi> The words of the Hebrew Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord run thus, <hi>All that went into the houſe of God went by the way of the right hand, except hee to whom ſome thing had befallen him: for which cauſe he turned towards the left hand.</hi> Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if any asked him, <hi>What is befallen thee, that thou turneſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the left hand?</hi> if he ſaid, <hi>Becauſe I have the</hi> Niddui <hi>upon me.</hi> (That is to ſay, <hi>the leſſer Excommunication.)</hi> Then the party anſwered him, <hi>He that dwelleth in this Houſe, give into thy heart, that thou maieſt hearken to the words of thy neighbour. vid. Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 30. From this Hebrew Record it is evident that his impenitency in not harkning to the words of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was the chief cauſe of his Excommunication.</p>

                     <hi>This Teſtimony of the Hebrew Doctors ſheweth that they held an Excommunicate perſon to be an alone perſon: becauſe he might not go in the common way of Converſe into the Temple, until they gave ſatisfaction to the offended brother, by their verbal and particular Repentance. But I wonder at this, Why was he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to come into the Temple, ſeeing many Godly Divines ſay, that an Excommunicate perſon ought not to come in within the Church door, becauſe it is ſaid,</hi> Let him bee to thee as an Heathen and Publican?</p>

                  <p>It is moſt certain that an Excommunicate perſon was excluded out of the Synagogue, till he repented; but not out of the Temple: therefore he was not to be held as an heathen in all reſpects; for a heathen might not come into the Temple at all; becauſe they were uncircumciſed, and unclean. <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 28. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 7. <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 20. but they might come into the Synagogue if they pleaſed; and ſo might not an Excommunicate perſon, till he had repented, and were releaſed of his Excommunication<hi>:</hi> but

                     <hi>Some Divines do think that the puniſhment of cutting off, ſo often threatned in the Levitical Law, for ſeveral tranſgreſſions againſt the Levitical Law, was nothing els but Excommunication.</hi>

                  <p>There is a wide difference between that puniſhment and excommunication: for the Hebrew Doctors do expound this Cutting off in the Levitical Law, to mean nothing elſe but Gods cutting men off, by an untimely death, if their ſin were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: but if their ſin were known, and witneſſed to the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> then they did puniſh the ſaid ſinner according to the nature of the ſinne, all circumſtances conſidered: ſome of thoſe ſinnes which God threatens with cutting off, they did puniſh with death, and others they puniſhed with ſcourging, or with Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in the place of ſcourging; but in caſe men did thoſe ſins ignorantly, they appointed ſuch to bring their ſacrifice of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement to the Prieſt, to be offered on the Lords Altar. <hi>vid.

                     <hi>Paul</hi> delivers this <hi>Anathema</hi> as a command, and therefore it muſt be regarded, and obeyed as all the other commands of God ought to be. The command is thus uttered; <hi>If any man love not the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, let him be Anathema Maranatha:</hi> that is to ſay, Let him be ſeparated to the Lords wrath (which is a river of fire from the fiery throne,) who cometh in the clouds of heaven, that is to ſay, With thouſands of Angels, to judge ſuch wicked perſecuters, <hi>Iude</hi> verſe 14. The not loving of Chriſt, by it ſelf ſimply conſidered, is no juſt ground of inflicting this curſe: for then the poor ignorant Heathen, which know nothing of Chriſt, ſhould be curſed with this <hi>Anathema:</hi> but no man I think will ſay ſo<hi>:</hi> therefore I expound this curſe to belong to ſuch as are ſo far from loving the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that they hate him, his Kingdom and ſervants.</p>
                  <p>Neither do I think that the Apoſtle doth command the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to execute this bitter <hi>Anathema,</hi> as a Church act upon any like unto the leſſer Excommunication, but either a whole Church, or any one Godly particular man, may denounce this bitter <hi>Curſe,</hi> upon incorrigible perſecutors. But no man can give this <hi>curſe</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that God hath not curſed, <hi>Num.</hi> 23. 8.

But this I ſay, I do not apprehend that this <hi>Anathema</hi> doth bind men over to the eternal curſe as moſt <hi>Expoſitors</hi> thinke, but to ſome exemplary judgement of God in this world <hi>(as thoſe four beaſts had.</hi> Daniel. 7.) ſuch as are open and incorrigible enemies to Chriſt and his Kingdom may and ought to be curſed by ſuch as love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: either they may threaten the venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Chriſt upon them from ſuch poſitive curſes as are in Gods Book delivered againſt ſuch, with a poſitive command; or elſe ſuch may be curſed by imprecating the wrath of Chriſt upon ſuch wilfull and implacable enemies.</p>
                  <p>And in this ſenſe, <hi>Chriſt bade</hi> Moſes <hi>to command all Iſrael to pronounce both the bleſſings and the curſes, as ſoon as they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land of Canaan, Then the Prieſts and the Levites ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the twelve Tribes, and pronounce both the bleſſings and the curſes with a loud voyce, and all the people ſaid,</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>Now the laſt of thoſe curſes was denounced againſt ſelf-Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaries; <hi>Curſed is he that continues not in all things that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of the Law to do them:</hi> Deut. 27. This laſt curſe muſt be underſtood of the eternal curſe, but all the reſt muſt be underſtood of temporal curſes chiefly.</p>
                  <p>By this Law, Chriſt taught his people how, and when, and whom to curſe. <hi>The Ruler may not be curſed. Exod.</hi> 22. 28. And yet ſuch Rulers as miſlead the people, and cauſe them to go aſtray in their practice, <hi>Are curſed, in Deut.</hi> 27. 13. And by this Law <hi>Paul curſed Ananias, Acts</hi> 23. 3.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaks this to all godly Chriſtians, they are bound to execute the curſe that is written, either by a poſitive denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe by way of imprecation, as the occaſion is offered.

thus godly <hi>David</hi> did, when his brethren.

                  <p>This phraſe, <hi>Whatſoever ye bind on earth, &amp;c.</hi> is a <hi>Talmudd</hi> phraſe, which phraſe of ſpeaking Chriſt had formerly uſed to his Apoſtles, when he gave them authority to preach the Goſpel, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. and now again he doth put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their calling and power to preach the Goſpel, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the ſaid <hi>Talmud</hi> phraſe: and he begins his <hi>memento</hi> to them with an aſſeveration. <hi>Amen, I ſay unto you, Whatſoever ye bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven;</hi> that is to ſay, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever perſon he or ſhe be that lives in ſin, without change of mind, ye ſhall by the preaching of the Goſpel bind him or them over to eternal condemnation; but whatſoever perſon he or ſhe be, that hath the truth of change of mind, according to the rules of the Goſpel, you ſhall looſe that perſon from his ſins, by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him his pardon, reconciliation and atonement, by reſting on Chriſt for his pardon and atonement.</p>
                  <p>And in this ſenſe every faithful Preacher doth bind on earth, and looſe too, though he never do excommunicate, nor releaſe any from their excommunication.</p>
                  <p>And if any man doubt whether this expoſition of this phraſe be to be underſtood of their power and authority to preach: let them confer hereto another place in <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 21. where our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour uſeth the like phraſe to his Apoſtles; and there he doth plainly expound it of their calling and power to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; for in verſe 21. Chriſt ſaith thus to his Apoſtles, <hi>As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> namely, <hi>to preach the Goſpel:</hi> and in verſe 23. he ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whoſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> This manner of ſpeaking implies, that they muſt teach according to the rules of the Goſpel: <hi>Whoſoever ſins ye remit</hi> according to the rules of the Goſpel, <hi>they are remitted:</hi> But the Goſpel doth not pronounce pardon of ſin to any but to the godly repenting, therefore you muſt remit no mans ſins but theirs only; to ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners you muſt preach remiſſion of ſins, for their ſins
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:118698:37"/>
are remitted in heaven. <hi>But whoſoever ſins you retain,</hi> according to the rules of the Goſpel, <hi>they are retained:</hi> You muſt tell all unrepentant ſinners, that without good change of mind, they ſhall all periſh eternally. Theſe are the limits of that commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Chriſt gives to all true preachers, when he doth firſt give them power and authority to preach the Goſpel<hi>:</hi> and I think that no ſound Divine dares deny this expoſition. And thus by comparing theſe Scriptures together, the true interpretation of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18. may be found out.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This phraſe, <hi>Whatſoever ye bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven,</hi> cannot be expounded of the Churches excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: For no Church is ſo perfect in judgment, as to know the ſpiritual eſtate of an excommunicate perſon: many godly perſons have been excommunicate for a particular ſin, and have died under their excommunication, and yet their ſin not bound in heaven, when they dyed<hi>:</hi> and ſome are unjuſtly excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: and ſome are releaſed from their excommunication, upon their verbal repentance only. In this caſe the Church cannot ſay, we know thy repentance is true, and therefore we do looſe thee from thy ſins on earth, and Chriſt doth alſo looſe thee from thy ſin in heaven<hi>:</hi> No Church can ſay thus.</p>
                  <p>But when a godly Miniſter doth preach remiſſion of ſins to the truly repentant ſinner, (or to a man thrt truly turns to the Lord) and preach everlaſting damnation to the unrepentent: they do not perſonate men, as they do when they excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſons, they only deliver the rules of the Goſpel to perſons in general<hi>:</hi> If any of their hearers can find themſelves ſo and ſo qualified, then they preach remiſſion of ſins to ſuch as do truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent (or turn to God. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 20) according to the rules of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and they preach damnation alſo to them that do not turn to God, that is, to the unrepentent. But a particular Church had need an of infallible Judgment in mens perſonal conditions, before ſhe can conclude that all her perſonal cenſures are ratified in heaven.</p>

                     <hi>Sir, I muſt confeſs that your expoſition of this verſe</hi> 18. <hi>doth ſet me at a gaze what to think of other mens Interpretations: but yet I am not fully ſatisfied: Therefore I will yet try further in another circumstance of the Text: It is ſaid in verſe</hi> 15. If he hear thee, thou haſt gained thy Brother. <hi>Theſe words imply, that the only end and aime which the innocent brother had, in telling his treſpaſſing brother of his fault, was to gain him from his ſin by</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:118698:38"/>
                     <hi>gaining him to repentance, to change of mind, therefore his end and aime was the ſame in verſe</hi> 16. <hi>in taking with him one or two: and therefore his end and aim was the ſame alſo in verſe</hi> 17. <hi>in telling the Church. Now if his end and aim was the ſame in all theſe proceedings, namely to bring him to repentance, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows by neceſſary conſequence, that the Churches dealing with him was either to bring him to change of mind, or elſe to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him, in caſe he ſhall ſtill remain unrepentant.</hi>

                  <p>I grant that the two firſt degrees of proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the brother offending, was only to gain him to the ſight of his ſin, and ſo to godly repentance for it. But the third degree of proceeding in telling the Church, might well have another end; namely, to bring him to ſome publike ſhame for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentancy (or non-change of mind) and to gain him to make ſome ſatisfaction for his injurious treſpaſſing againſt him.</p>

                     <hi>Do you make the word</hi> Treſpaſs <hi>in this Text, to mean ſuch ſins only as do treſpaſs or hurt a mans brother? Very learned Divines do take it to ſignifie all kinds of ſin, as well againſt God immediately, as mediately againſt man.</hi>

                  <p>I acknowledge that the Greek word uſed in this Text is often put as well for ſin againſt God, as for ſin againſt man<hi>:</hi> But moſt uſually it is put for ſin or treſpaſs againſt man: and me-thinks that the circumſtances of this Text do carry it plainly of ſin againſt a mans brother<hi>: If thy brother ſin againſt thee,</hi> namely, by hurting or injuring thy perſon, goods, or good name, then thou ſhalt tell him his fault between him and thee alone.</p>
                  <p>2. This kind of ſin is ſuch a ſin, as a brother may forgive, and ſo <hi>Luke</hi> doth explain our Saviour to mean, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 3. But a brother cannot forgive a ſin againſt God; and ſo <hi>Eli</hi> ſaith, <hi>If a man ſin againſt God, who ſhall plead for him?</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25. therefore the ſin here ſpoken of, is not to be underſtood of ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God immediatly, but of ſuch ſins as a brother may forgive by paſſing by it, and not revenging it, in caſe his brother teſtifies his ſorrow and repentance for it. In this ſenſe <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren ſinned againſt <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> as <hi>Reuben</hi> doth explain the nature of their ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 22. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 21, 22. And therefore, after <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob was dead, all</hi> Joſephs <hi>Brethren came to him and confeſſed their ſin</hi> (many yeers after,) <hi>and they prayed</hi> Joſeph <hi>to forgive their Treſpaſs and their ſin. Gen.</hi> 50. 17. They did not pray him to forgive their ſin, as it was a ſin againſt God, for in that ſenſe they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:118698:38"/>
knew that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> could not forgive it, but as it was a ſin againſt his perſon, in that ſenſe they knew he might forgive it if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and he did forgive it, though it were a ſin of the higheſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for the ſin that is done againſt a mans perſon, is far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then that which is done againſt a mans goods: and ſo the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Doctors affirm; they ſay if a man have done his neighbour dammage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n his goods, aſſoon as he hath paid that which he ought to pay, atonement is made for him.</p>
                  <p>But he that hurteth his neighbours perſon, although he give unto him for ſatisfaction all the five things ſpoken of in <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 13. yet atonement is not made for him thereby, yea though he <hi>ſhould ſacrifice unto God all the Rams of Nebaioth,</hi> Eſ. 60. 7. yet atonement is not made for him, nor his iniquity forgiven, until he requeſt it of <hi>Him</hi> that was hurt, and he do forgive it him. <hi>Ainſ. in Gen.</hi> 50. 17.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour alſo gives the like rule of caution; <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembreſt thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thine offering before the Altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> Mat. 5. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This kind of ſin againſt a brother, may be explained by other inſtances. <hi>Jonathan</hi> entreated <hi>Saul not to ſin againſt</hi> David, <hi>becauſe</hi> David <hi>did not ſin againſt him.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 4. And ſo <hi>David</hi> pleaded with <hi>Saul</hi> (when he cut off the skirt of his robe) <hi>Know thou, and ſee that there is neither evil nor tranſgreſſion in my hands, I have not ſinned againſt thee, yet thou hunteſt my ſoul to take it.</hi> 1 Sam. 24. 11.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe alſo <hi>Iacob</hi> asked <hi>Laban, What is my treſpaſs, and what is my ſin, that thou haſt ſo hotly purſued after me,</hi> Gen. 31. 36. the 70. tranſlate this phraſe thus, <hi>What is my injury, and what is my ſin? Shimei</hi> alſo met <hi>David</hi> at his return, <hi>and acknowledged that he had ſinned againſt him, and deſired pardon,</hi> thereupon Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>accepted of his acknowledgment, and forgave him.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 19, 20. 23. <hi>David</hi> forgave the ſin that was done to his perſon, but <hi>David</hi> could not forgive his ſin as it was done againſt God.</p>
                  <p>So the prodigal ſon, when he had ſinned againſt his Father, in waſting his Fathers goods<hi>:</hi> he confeſſed his ſin againſt his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſaid, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and againſt thee:</hi> Luke 15. 18. and his Father forgave him the ſins that were done againſt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:118698:39"/>
Breach of promiſe is a great ſinne againſt man, as <hi>Iudah</hi> did acknowledge unto <hi>Iacob. vide Ainſ. in Gen</hi> 43. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 44. 32. which a man may forgive to his brother.</p>
                  <p>4. It is plain that Chriſt ſpeaks in this Text of ſuch a kind of ſin as a brother may forgive, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> demands this queſtion in <hi>ver.</hi> 21. in relation to Chriſts exhortation, <hi>How oft ſhall my brother ſinne againſt me, and I forgive him?</hi> Our Saviour by his anſwer to the end of the Chapter, ſheweth that he ſpake of the ſin of injurious dealing againſt a mans brother, and our Saviour doth much inculcate upon this point of dealing brotherly in point of wrongs and injuries: and in his form of Prayer he doth lay it down, as one of the conditions of thoſe Petitions, which we ought to make unto God in our dayly prayers, <hi>To forgive us our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſſe againſt us.</hi> Matth. 6. 12. and in verſe 14. he enforceth this point by this reaſon; <hi>If you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you; but if you do not forgive men their treſpaſſes, no more will your heavenly Father forgive you your treſpaſſes.</hi> And in this ſence Chriſt did conclude his anſwer to <hi>Peters</hi> queſtion. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 35. All theſe places compared together, do plainly evidence that the kind of ſin Chriſt ſpeaks of in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. is no other but the ſin of treſpaſs or injury which one brother may do unto another.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>It ſeems to me that our Saviour doth exhort his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to rebuke a brother for every ſinne they ſee in him: for ſinne againſt God, as well as for ſinne againſt man: As for example, if a man hear his brother ſwear a vain oath, ought he not to rebuke his brother for it; and if he repent not then, to take one or two with him, &amp;c. Yet that ſin doth no hurt to a mans brother, it is onely a ſinne againſt God immediately?</hi>

                  <p>The point about which we reaſon, is about a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe; namely about a brother ſinning injuriouſly againſt a brother. But now you ſtart a queſtion about ſinne againſt God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately: Whether a man that ſees his brother ſin againſt God, immediately ought not to rebuke him for it. I will anſwer as plainly as I can. Firſt I ſay, that all ſinne in general ought to be rebuked. But yet ſecondly, I ſay, that this duty of rebuking ſinne againſt God muſt be grounded on ſome other command of Chriſt that is more large then this in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. namely, it muſt be grounded upon the ſecond or third Commandments, or upon <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. Which I conceive is a general command to rebuke
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118698:39"/>
all kind of ſinne in all ſorts of perſons, as farre as any brother may have a neceſſary calling thereunto, <hi>or elſe</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>He hates his brother in his heart, and muſt bear ſinne for him: and if he remain impenitent or perverſe, he ought to complain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to authority, provided he can witneſs his complaint.</hi> But this extraordinary command in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. is a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular command to rebuke a treſpaſſing brother in a private way firſt, which is a loving and honourable kind of dealing, and this duty is of neceſſary concernment to be practiſed for the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Chriſtian love and ſociety, as I have above noted it from our Saviours large anſwer to <hi>Peters</hi> queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Therefore now I conclude from all the premiſſes, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not ordain excommunication in this Text: no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then he ordained ſcourging, fining, or the like puniſhments, for the correction of unrepenting ſinners, ſuch as the Church or Court of Magiſtrates ſhould ſee cauſe to inflict upon complaint and proof.</p>

                     <hi>Do you hold the word Church in</hi> Matth. 18. 17. <hi>to be a Court of Magiſtrates? learned Divines hold it to be meant of a particular Chriſtian Church aſſembled together both Elders and Members.</hi>

                  <p>I apprehend that the word Church in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. <note place="margin">This phraſe, <hi>Tell the Church:</hi> means nothing elſe, but tell the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi>
                     </note> Muſt be taken for a Court of Magiſtrates, and that it cannot be taken for a particular Chriſtian Church of Elders and Members aſſembled together.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe there were no particular Chriſtian Churches as yet eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is plain by the circumſtances of the Text that Chriſt ſpake of ſuch a Church as was in preſent being, unto which the preſent offended brother might repair for juſtice againſt his unrepentant treſpaſſing brother<hi>:</hi> or elſe how could his Diſciples practice his Doctrine, ſeeing he doth nor explain himſelf to ſpeak of Chriſtian Churches.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is evident that Chriſt ſpake of ſuch a Church, as was in preſent being among the Jews; becauſe he applies his ſpeeches to the preſent Jews capacity, <hi>Let him be to thee as an Heathen and Publican.</hi> This phraſe is not ſutable to a particular Chriſtian Church<hi>:</hi> for Chriſtians might company with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Publicans. But the Jews might not hold communion with any unclean and uncircumciſed Heathens, as <hi>Peters</hi> refuſing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118698:40"/>
to go to <hi>Cornelius</hi> doth teſtifie. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. Neither did Chriſtians hate Publicans, but the Jews in general did, becauſe they raiſed them up in the point of Tribute to <hi>Ceſar.</hi> But converted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were allowed to eat and drink with Heathens in civil feaſtings except it were in the Idols Temple; and they might alſo eat and drink with Publicans, as our Saviour and his Diſciples often did, though the Jews in general (through their own unjuſt tradition) took offence at Chriſt for it.</p>

                     <hi>Can you make it manifeſt by Scripture with good reaſon, that a Court of Magiſtrates are a Church: Learned men affirm the contrary. They affirm that a Court of Magiſtrates is no where called a Church in Scripture.</hi>

                  <p>I will anſwer you fully and plainly: I affirm that a Court of Magiſtrates is often called a Church in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is evident that the Hebrew word <hi>Kahal</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A Court of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, is a Church in Scripture phraſe.</note> is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 30. muſt be underſtood of the Elders and Officers of the Church onely, which alſo were the Magiſtrates of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal<hi>:</hi> they did now aſſemble unto <hi>Moſes out of all the Tribes:</hi> as it appears by comparing <hi>verſe</hi> 30. with <hi>verſe</hi> 28. Therefore the ſaid Elders with their Officers attending on them were called the Church. They were the whole Church repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively; and it may be further obſerved that <hi>Kahal</hi> in this place is tranſlated by the ſeventy <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the whole Church did ſin ignorantly in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe againſt ſome branch or other of the Law of God<hi>: then the Church must bring a ſin-offering,</hi> and it is called <hi>the Churches ſin-offering,</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. 13, 14. 21. and yet the Common people of the <hi>twelve Tribes did not aſſemble to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to preſent this Church ſin-offering, but the Elders or Magistrates of the</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin <hi>did it, without the preſence of the people,</hi> Levit. 4. 15. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Elders of the Court <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> are a true Church repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatively.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Kahal</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> 1 Chron. 13. 2. 4. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 1. is nothing elſe but the Captains of thouſands, and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, with the Governours or Elders of the Court <hi>Sanhedrin;</hi> and the 70. tranſlate this <hi>Kahal</hi> by <hi>Eccleſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Kahal</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> in 1 Chron. 29. 1. 10. 20. Is nothing elſe but the Elders of the Court <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> together with other chief. Princes and Captains of thouſands, and Captains of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, &amp;c. As it is evident by comparing this place with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>

28. 1. 8. This <hi>Kahal</hi> alſo is tranſlated by the ſeventie <hi>Eccleſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Kahal</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 3. 5. is nothing elſe but the Captains of thouſands and hundreds with the Judges and every Governour in all <hi>Iſrael:</hi> all theſe did accompany <hi>Salomon</hi> to ſeek the Lord at <hi>Gibeon:</hi> all this aſſembly of Governors and chiefe Fathers, are called a great Church: This <hi>Kahal</hi> is alſo tranſlated by the 70. <hi>Eccleſia.</hi>

                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Kahal</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> 2 Chron. 23. 28. 31. 32. &amp; in 2 Chron. 3. 2. 4. is explained in 2 Chron. 29. 20. to be nothing elſe but the Rulers of the City aſſembled together in a <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Court; that is to ſay, there was the 70. Elders of the high <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin,</hi> and the <hi>Elders</hi> of the two other <hi>Sanhedrins,</hi> who had their reſidence in <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> (as I noted above in opening the kinds of <hi>Sanhedrins)</hi> and this matter is alſo further explained, in <hi>verſe</hi> 28. 31. 32. and in 2 <hi>Chron. Chap.</hi> 30. 2. 4.</p>
                  <p>This Aſſembly of <hi>Elders</hi> is termed a Church in all the ſaid verſes, both in the Hebrew, and in the ſeventy. The generaltie of the people did not come to the firſt Paſſe-over in the firſt moneth<hi>:</hi> Therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> took counſel of this Church of <hi>Elders,</hi> and they counſelled him to gather together all the people on the fourteenth day of the ſecond moneth<hi>:</hi> So then <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> and the <hi>Elders</hi> made a Church by themſelves in the point of Counſel in the firſt moneth. But in the ſecond moneth, both the <hi>Elders</hi> and the people together made a very great Church: and theſe degrees of Church meetings were ordained by <hi>Moſes:</hi> If one Trumpet alone ſounded, then the <hi>Elders</hi> came alone to the Church-meeting; but if both Trumpets ſounded together, then both <hi>Elders</hi> and People did meet together in one Church-Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, <hi>vide Numb.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Kahal</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> tranſlated by the ſeventy <hi>Eccleſia</hi> in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 14. is nothing elſe but the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Samaria</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together: For by the counſel of the Prophet <hi>Oded,</hi> certain of the Heads of the children of <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſtood up againſt the Souldiers that were returned from warring againſt <hi>Iudah:</hi> And they ſaid unto the Souldiers, ye ſhall not bring the captaives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this City; and the armed men obeyed their voice, and left all the captives before the Princes, and before all the Church: This Church therefore is nothing elſe but the Magiſtrates of <hi>Samaria,</hi> which were aſſembled to this place by the counſel of <hi>Oded</hi> the Prophet to prevent the further occaſion of Gods wrath.</p>

8. The word <hi>Church,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 1, 2, 3. 8. is <hi>Kahal</hi> in all the four places, and in the Seventy, <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> in one of theſe four places it is ſaid, that <hi>a Moabite and an Ammonite may not enter into the Church of Iehovah for ever.</hi> This place doth not exclude a converted <hi>Ammonite</hi> or a <hi>Moabite</hi> from the Church of the Jewes: but yet it did exclude them from bearing any Office in their Church or Publique Courts; and ſo both the Hebrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and ſome learned Chriſtians do underſtand the word <hi>Church</hi> in this text to be ſpoken of the Church of Elders aſſembled in the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Court: a <hi>Moabite</hi> or an <hi>Ammonite,</hi> though convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Faith, yet they might not bear any Office in the Church-Court. So Mr <hi>Broughton</hi> expounds the word <hi>Church</hi> in this place, and ſo doth Mr <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in effect.</p>
                  <p>In another of theſe four places it is ſaid, <hi>The Prieſt which was hurt in his privy members, might not enter into the Church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, Deut.</hi> 23. 1. He might not enter in, to wait upon his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as a Prieſt compleat; neither might he enter into the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin</hi> Court, to bear any Office there, as long as that part was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, but he was not excluded from coming into the Temple; he might come thither to do ſome inferiour works. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, He might cleave wood in the Wood-chamber, and in that reſpect, he muſt have his portion in the holy things; therefore he was not excluded from the Church at large: he was only exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from bearing ſpecial Office in the Church as a Prieſt compleat, and as a Magiſtrate: For this phraſe, <hi>He ſhall not enter in, or come in,</hi> is expounded, [To beare Office as a Magiſtrate,] 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 9.</p>
                  <p>9. The <hi>Congregation of the gods, Pſal.</hi> 82. 1. is tranſlated by the Seventy, <hi>the Synagogue of the gods:</hi> it may be as well tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated [the Church of the gods;] for the ſeventy do often put the term <hi>Synagogue,</hi> for the term <hi>Church,</hi> and for the term <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. vid. Ainſ. Exod.</hi> 21. 6.</p>
                  <p>10. The Congregation before whom the man-ſlayer muſt ſtand in judgement, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 12. &amp;c. and <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 20. 6. is term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Seventy, the Synagogue or Church of Elders: for I finde theſe three termes, <hi>Congregation, Synagogue,</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> often put the one for the other, as termes <hi>Synonima.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. <hi>Salomon</hi> deſcribes the courſe of Juſtice againſt an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent perſon, much like to that courſe of Juſtice which Chriſt doth direct us to, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. He ſaith, <hi>That hee</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:118698:41"/>
                     <hi>whoſe hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedneſſe ſhall bee ſhewed before the whole Church. Prov.</hi> 26. 26. The Hebrew word in this place is <hi>Kahal;</hi> but the Seventy tranſlate it, the <hi>Synedrion,</hi> or <hi>the Seſſion of Elders. Salomon</hi> by this phraſe <hi>[his hatred is covered by deceit,]</hi> doth imply, that hee will not acknowledge his fault to his neighbour, but did labour to cover his hatred to his brother by deceit<hi>:</hi> thereupon the matter muſt be brought before the Church, or Court of Elders, called the <hi>Synedrion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And our Saviour doth tell us, that contumelious nick-names (ſuch as <hi>Raca</hi> is in the <hi>Talmud)</hi> were a juſt cauſe to bring ſuch a perſon before the Elders of the <hi>Synedrion, Matth.</hi> 5. 22. or at leaſt they were lyable to be brought thither<hi>:</hi> and the Greek word in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22. is <hi>Synedrion:</hi> and ſo the word <hi>Church,</hi> in <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 17. is <hi>Synedrion</hi> in the ſeventy.</p>
                  <p>12. The Church is commanded to <hi>rejoyce in the Feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, with exceeding joy; with muſick, ſongs, and palm-bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in their hands. Levit.</hi> 23. 40. But this kinde of joy was not acted by the whole multitude of the Church, but by the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Court only, for they were the whole Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatively. <hi>vid.</hi> M. <hi>Ainſ.</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 40.</p>
                  <p>13. Not only the Elders aſſembled in the high <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> but all the Elders of their inferiour <hi>Sanhedrins</hi> in each <hi>Seſſion,</hi> might well be called a <hi>Church:</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 32. <hi>Let them exalt him in the Church of the people, and praiſe him in the ſitting of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> The term <hi>Church, and the ſitting of the Elders,</hi> are terms <hi>Synonima</hi> in this Text. The manner how the Jews did exalt God in the Church of the people; and praiſe him in the ſitting of the Elders, is thus recorded by the Hebrew Doctors. Men made confeſſion unto God, for four ſorts of deliverances, <hi>before ten men,</hi> whereof two of them muſt be wiſe men. After this manner they exalted God before the Church of the people, becauſe it was done before ſome of the Elders of the Church, who may be called <hi>[a Church,]</hi> for ſo they are called repreſentatively.</p>
                  <p>And marvel not that two Elders, or two wiſe men, are called <hi>[A Church;]</hi> for if <hi>Symeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> aſſembled together in Counſel, about the deſtruction of the <hi>Sychemites,</hi> be called <hi>Kahal,</hi> a Church, as they are in <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 6. then two wiſe men, or <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> with eight of the people in their company, may as well be called <hi>A Church of people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Kahal,</hi> the Church, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 14. tranſlated by the <hi>Septu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agint</hi>

                     <hi>[Eccleſia,]</hi> means the Aſſembly or Court of Elders: the words of the text run thus. <hi>I was almoſt in all evil, in the midſt of the Church and Aſſembly.</hi> The Seventy have the like phraſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word <hi>Church,</hi> in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 8. <hi>Now therefore in the ſight of all Iſrael, the Church of the Lord:</hi> this Church was nothing elſe but the Congregation of Elders, compared with verſe 1. and with chap. 29. 1 - 10 - 20. Theſe Elders were the chief Doctours in <hi>Moſes</hi> Laws; and therefore thoſe that lived in evil, contrary to their teaching, might well fear the evil of puniſhment, when they ſtood in the middeſt of their Church and Aſſembly, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> warneth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Ieſus Ben Syrack,</hi> one of the former Hebrew Doctors, ſince the Prophets, puts the word <hi>[Church,]</hi> for a counſel of wiſe and learned men. He firſt ſhews the un-aptneſſe of Artificers, for matters of Counſel and Judicature, <hi>they ſhall not be ſought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in matters of publique Counſel, neither ſhall they ſit high in the Church, nor ſit in the Iudges ſeat, nor underſtand the ſentences of Iudgement. Ecclus.</hi> 8. 24. 33. In theſe words he doth plainly make the Elders of the Court <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> to be a <hi>Church</hi> by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>16. The ſame Authour ſaith, <hi>that the adulterous wife ſhall be brought into the Church, and inquiſition and examination ſhall be made of her children, Ecclus.</hi> 23. 22 - 24. he ſaith plainly, that <hi>the adulterous woman ſhall be brought before the Church of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and they ſhall make inquiſition concerning the Legitimacy or baſtardy of her children:</hi> And after this ſort the Congregation or Church of Elders ſit to judge them that had taken ſtrange wives, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10. 14. 16.</p>
                  <p>17. It is no more abſurditie to call the Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> a Church<hi>:</hi> then it is to call a Court of Heathen Magiſtrates, a <hi>Church.</hi> But a Court of Heathen Magiſtrates are called a <hi>Church</hi> properly; for the Town-Clerk of <hi>Epheſus</hi> told <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his conſorts, that if they had any thing to lay againſt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> it ſhould be determined in a lawfull Church, that is to ſay, it ſhould be legally determined in an Aſſembly of Magiſtrates, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 39. Therefore ſeeing a Court of Heathen Magiſtrates are properly called a Church; why may not that Church in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. be taken for a Court of Elders, ſeeing the Elders of all their <hi>Synedrions</hi> were the choſen Elders of the Church for all matters, and therefore were or ought to bee learned and expert in all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118698:42"/>
the Lawes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> both Leviticall and Judiciall.</p>
                  <p>18. Thoſe eminent perſons in the Church of Corinth, that ſpake with Tongues and propheſied; are called a Church by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. Thus the text is, <hi>when the whole Church is come together into one, and [all] ſpeak ſtrange tongues:</hi> No man that is well adviſed will ſay that the word <hi>Church</hi> in this place, doth mean the whole people in general: the word <hi>[all]</hi> muſt not have that ſence, except you will ſay [alſo] <hi>that the whole multitude ſpake with ſtrange tongues:</hi> but no man (I think) will ſay ſo<hi>:</hi> therefore the word [all] and the word <hi>Church,</hi> muſt have reference to thoſe only that ſpake with ſtrange Tongues. Theſe only are called <hi>the whole Church,</hi> by the figure <hi>Synecdoche.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is ſaid, <hi>every one that hath a Pſalme, or hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath interpretation:</hi> this phraſe <hi>[every one]</hi> muſt not be taken vulgarly for every one of the common multitude of the Church. The Apoſtle himſelf doth contradict that Expoſition; for he doth teach us to oppoſe the learned to the unlearned, in <hi>ver.</hi> 23. 24. therefore he doth exempt the unlearned, as not fit to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted into the number of every one that hath a Pſalm &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe two phraſes, <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every one:</hi> means <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every one</hi> of thoſe only whom God had gifted with extraordinary gifts, for the plantation of his Church<hi>:</hi> theſe only the Apoſtle calls the whole Church, by the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> becauſe they were the chiefe guides and directions of the multitude.</p>
                  <p>19. The word Church is of a large capacity; it ſignifies an Aſſembly of any kind of men: and therefore it may as well be applyed to an aſſembly of Magiſtrates, in a Court of Juſtice, as to any other Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The whole Army of <hi>Sauls</hi> ſouldiers that lay incamped in the field againſt the Philiſtims, are called <hi>Kahal</hi> a Church<hi>:</hi> and in the Septuagint, <hi>Eccleſia.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 47.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Army againſt Iſrael, is called <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal,</hi> a Church, and in the ſeventy, <hi>Eccleſia.</hi> Ezek. 16. 40.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> ſeveral companies of ſouldiers collected into ſeveral bands out of ſeveral Nations, are called Churches, in the plural number, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26. 7. and in the ſeventy, Synagogues.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Perſian Army is alſo called a <hi>Church:</hi> Ier. 50. 9. and in the ſeptuagint, <hi>a Synagogue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> army is alſo called <hi>Kahal,</hi> a Church. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. 17.</p>

                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:118698:43"/>
Sixthly, The Army of <hi>Gog</hi> is four times over called <hi>Kahal,</hi> a <hi>Church,</hi> and in the ſeventy, <hi>a Synagogue. Ezek</hi> 38. 4. 7. 13. 15.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, all the multitude of Iſrael that came out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> are called <hi>Kahal, a Church,</hi> before ever they entred into that Church Covenant which God made with them in <hi>Horeb. Exod.</hi> 16. 3.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is no abſurdity to call a Court of Elders <hi>a Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>20. A confuſed multitude of people may be called a <hi>Church:</hi> therefore much more an orderly Aſſembly of Elders in a Court of Juſtice. In <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 32. It is ſaid, <hi>that the Church was confuſed that roſe up againſt</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Alexander<hi>:</hi> and in verſe 41. <hi>The Town-Clark diſmiſſed the Church,</hi> that is to ſay, the diſorderly multitude: and <hi>Syracides</hi> puts the word <hi>Church,</hi> for <hi>a diſorderly multitude of evil doers.</hi> Ecclus 26. 5.</p>
                  <p>21. A company of wicked and corrupt Elders may be called a <hi>Church,</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26. 5. <hi>I hated the Church of evil doers;</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Synedrion</hi> of <hi>Sauls</hi> flattering Counſellors. And <hi>Iacob</hi> alſo in his laſt will, ſpeaking of the bloudy action of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> ſaith, <hi>O my ſoul come not thou into their ſecret, and unto their Church mine honour be not thou united. Gen.</hi> 49. 6. Hence it follows, that the conclave of Cardinals in <hi>Rome,</hi> may be truly and properly called a Church: and the general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of <hi>Cardinals, Biſhops,</hi> and other <hi>Popiſh Doctors,</hi> may truly and properly be called a Church: though alſo they ought to be called a malignant Church, or a Synagogue of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I wonder why any man of learning and wiſdom ſhould account it ſuch a ſtrange matter to interpret the word Church in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. to mean the Elders of the <hi>Synedrion-Court:</hi> eſpecially conſidering they were the Churches choſen Elders, appointed to ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, to expound <hi>Moſes</hi> laws, and to puniſh all the Tranſgreſſors thereof with ſutable puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and though they were grown now more degenerate then in former times, yet they had ſome godly Elders among them, as <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, doubtles here and there diſperſed among their ſeveral <hi>Sanhedrins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will conclude theſe one and twenty Collections with this Summe.</p>

Firſt, <hi>Their opinion, that,</hi> Tell the Church, <hi>requireth a new Court; would breed new ſpeech in the New Teſtament. But our Lord ſpake it, as is evident, of the Church of Elders, of the Politie known and practiſed of old in Iſrael,</hi> Bro. in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript.</p>

But for the better performance of the ſame publick Faith and Worſhip, they are fitly divided and diſtributed into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular viſible Churches: And my reaſons for calling all viſible Profeſſors an univerſal viſible Church of Chriſt, are theſe. 1. What other Temple of God can that be, wherein Antichriſt doth ſit as God, but the univerſal viſible Church of Chriſt diſperſed over the world? Antichriſt cannot be ſaid to ſit as a God in any one particular Congregational Church; but he ſits in the Temple of God, even as Chriſt ſat formerly in the Temple between the Cherubims, whither the twelve Tribes reſorted three times a year; And theſe twelve Tribes are called <hi>a Church of Nations,</hi> Geneſis. 28. 3. Becauſe they Typified all the outward Profeſſors of the Faith in all Nations, as well as the inward Profeſſors of the Faith all the world over. In this outward Temple or Church An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, did ſet up the throne of his Dominion, to rule them and govern them after his own will, by his own Laws and Decrees.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What other Church was it which <hi>Paul</hi> did perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, but the univerſall viſible Church of Chriſt. He ſaith, that in times paſt he did perſecute the Church of God, and waſted it; he is not ſaid to perſecute any one particular Church, but he perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Church of God in general not in <hi>Iudea</hi> onely, but in other ſtrange Conntries and Cities alſo: that is to ſay, he perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted divers Godly perſons that believed in Chriſt, and which as yet continued in ſeveral Synagogues, in ſeveral Countries. <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 19. &amp; 26. 11. All theſe viſible Profeſſors of the Faith in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Synagogues, and in ſeveral Countries, the Apoſtle calls them all together, <hi>The Church of God in the ſingular number,</hi> Gal. 1. 13. Phil. 3. 6. Though they were not perſonally united into one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular viſible Church; yet they were united together by the ſame Faith into one univerſal viſible Church, The Jeruſalem from Heaven.</p>
                  <p>3. What other Church was it whereof <hi>Paul was made a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that he might preach unto the Heathen the unſearchable riches and myſteries of Chriſt, that the Church might know the manifold wiſdom of God?</hi> Eph. 3. 8. 10. &amp; verſe 21. He deſires that praiſe may be given for it in the Church through all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for ever. But <hi>Paul</hi> was not made a Miniſter to any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, but to the Church of Chriſt in General.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:118698:44"/>
4. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians, that God had ordained in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily, Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> For what particular Church did God ordain theſe Officers? ſurely, not for any particular Church; therefore they were ordained for the good of the general viſible Church, diſperſed over all the world where ever a doore of entrance was opened to them<hi>:</hi> and when Chriſt gave them a new Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel at his Aſcention, he did not ſend them to any particular Church, but appointed them to preach the Goſpel to all Nations in the world.</p>
                  <p>5. Chriſt made a promiſe unto <hi>Iacob, That he ſhould grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Church of Nations.</hi> Gen. 28. 3. Gen. 35. 15. &amp; 48. 4. This Church of Nations muſt be underſtood of an univerſal viſible Church, diſperſed into all nations as well as of the inviſible Church (as I noted in the firſt mark of an univerſall viſible Church.) The univerſal viſible Church, doth include the Elect among others that hope to go to Heaven, as well as they by their outward Profeſſion. Therefore all outward Profeſſors of the Faith may be well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Children of <hi>Iacob,</hi> becauſe they profeſs the Faith of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and becauſe they are begotten to this Faith by the children of <hi>Iacob.</hi> For the twelve Apoſtles, and the ſeventy Diſciples were of <hi>Iacobs</hi> loyns. They begate other Preachers who begate many children unto the Faith of <hi>Iacob:</hi> Therefore all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Faith may well be called the children of <hi>Iacob. (Galathians</hi> 6. 16.) And thus <hi>Iacob</hi> did grow into a Church of Nations.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew Doctors ſay, That God did not onely ordain the twelve Tribes to make one National Church; but they ſay alſo, That every Tribe was a Church by it ſelf (as I have formerly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.) It is written in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 5. that <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> in the Church of <hi>Iudah; Here the Tribe of Iudah is called a Church:</hi> And ſo it is again in verſe 24. and in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 25. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay the Hebrew Doctors, <hi>When the Church brought a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock for a ſinne-offering,</hi> as it was commanded in <hi>Leviticus</hi> 4. 14. The Elders of the <hi>Sanhedrin brought twelve Bullocks for twelve Churches,</hi> becauſe every Tribe made a Church by it ſelf. <hi>Vide Ainſworth in Leviticus</hi> 4. 14. and <hi>Numbers.</hi> 15. 34.</p>
                  <p>And it ſeems to me that every Tribe made ſuch a kind of Church by it ſelf, as a Chriſtian Nation is<hi>:</hi> For I apprehend that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118698:45"/>
a Chriſtian Nation may be called a Church, as well as a Tribe by it ſelf may.</p>

                  <p>The Sonne of God, the Eternal Wiſdom, hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <note place="margin">Chriſt hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Schools of learning for the continual rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, Teachers, Elders, &amp;c. For the good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Church and Common-weal, to the end of the world.</note> ſchools of Learning to be erected every where for the education of youths, in all good literature, until they might attain to gifts and parts of learning and godlineſs, by which they may be made fit for any place of government, either in Church or Common-Weal. I ſay, it is evident that Chriſt ordained ſchools of learning to be erected every where for <hi>Seminaries and Seed-plots of able men, fit to bear Office in particular viſible Churches, and Common-Weal.</hi> Becauſe from time to time, Jeſus Chriſt did ſtir up divers Prophets and other excellent perſons to rule and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Schools of learning.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt ſtirred up <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet to erect ſchools of learning when he was King over all the twelve Tribes, he kept a ſchool at <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Ramah:</hi> wherein he trained up di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſcholars in ſuch a way of learning, as might ſit them for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie: and therefore when <hi>Saul</hi> came thither to ſeek <hi>David, The bleſſing of the Prophets School fell upon him, and he did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie whiles he was there;</hi> and thereupon grew a Proverb by way of Admiration, <hi>Is</hi> Saul <hi>among the Prophets?</hi> 1 Sam. 19.</p>
                  <p>Seconly, there was another Prophets ſchool erected at <hi>Bethel,</hi> in a high piece of ground, which was called <hi>The Hill of God:</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 3. 5. And we may ſee the care of Godly <hi>Samuel</hi> to train
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118698:46"/>
up young men in learning, that ſo there might be a ſucceſſion of Prophets, and of other able men fit to bear Office in Church and Common-weal, when he was dead and gone; and though <hi>Saul</hi> came not to this laſt ſchool, with any intent to be a ſcholar there: yet he obtained a Prophetical gift from their ſociety; and this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical gift did ſignifie to him, what great need he had of the beſt gifts of learning from the Prophetical School to execute the Kingly Office that was now laid upon him. And by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical gift which fell upon him after he was anointed, he was confirmed and ſtrengthned in his Office.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe the ſeventy Elders, as ſoon as they were choſen to bear Office in the high <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Court, <hi>they were confirmed in that Office by the immediate gift of Propheſie.</hi> Numb. 11. 20. to 30. And thoſe gifts of Propheſie which fell upon them in that day, did point unto them what manner of men they ought to be, that ſhould enter into ſuch a weighty Office and Calling. Sometimes our glorious Mediator did extraordinarily fit men for places of publick imployment. But ordinarily he did fit men to ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent places, by training them up in the Prophets ſchools.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Hebrew Doctors do often make mention of theſe Prophetical Schools from ancient times. They ſay, <hi>That</hi> Sem <hi>or</hi> Melchiſedech <hi>was a Teacher of Schools, when he was the King of</hi> Salem.</p>
                  <p>Abraham <hi>was a Prophet, and had a houſe of Doctrine, and did exerciſe his gifts in Teaching his Houſhold the way and charge of Chriſt in his Commandments, Statutes, and Laws; and withall commanded them to walk in the way,</hi> (that is, <hi>the Faith and Religion) of the Son of God, and to do Iuſtice and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rabbins</hi> ſay alſo in the <hi>Ieruſalem-paraphraſe,</hi> that <hi>Iſaac went from the School-houſe of</hi> Sem <hi>the great, to the Well where the Majeſtie of the Lord had been revealed. vide</hi> Ainſworth, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis 24. 62. This Hebrew Record is probably true; becauſe, <hi>It is certain that</hi> Sem <hi>was ſtill living in the dayes of</hi> Iſaac, as it is evident by comparing <hi>the years of his life, in</hi> Geneſis 11. 11. with <hi>the Story of</hi> Iſaac <hi>in</hi> Geneſis 24. But however you may take this Hebrew Record as a <hi>Proſopopeia</hi> to ſet forth the dignitie, and the antiquitie of School learning. And out of queſtion it might as well become <hi>Sem,</hi> Sacrificer to the moſt high God and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118698:46"/>
King of <hi>Salem,</hi> to keep a Propheticall ſchool after the confuſion of tongues (that moſt lamentable curſe and plague) as King <hi>Samuel:</hi> and he might well train up his Nephew <hi>Iſaac</hi> in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeeing he knew that he ſhould be heir of the promiſe after he was dead and gone. And doubtleſſe, <hi>Sem was the great Doctor of that age:</hi> and ſo the Hebrew Doctors do often ſtile him, <hi>SEM the Great. vid.</hi> Ainſ. Gen. 14. 18.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Hebrew Doctors ſay, <hi>That</hi> Jacob <hi>was a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of learning, and that he dwelt in Tents, and ſtudied the Law all his dayes:</hi> But <hi>Eſau the wicked, walked in the way of death to kill</hi> Jacob. <hi>vide</hi> Ainſworth Geneſis 25. 27. The <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Iacob was a Maſter of a Houſe of Doctrine:</hi> as giving himſelf to religious ſtudy and Scholarſhip.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Iacob</hi> departing to the Heavenly Citie and Countrie, left the Faith of the Sonne of God in his glorious Family; and in ſpecial propheſieth, <hi>That</hi> Judahs <hi>Tribe ſhould have Teachers of</hi> Judahs Shiloh. <hi>(The great Myſtery of Godlimeſs, God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh) and Expounders of the Law, that to him all the Nations ſhould be gathered,</hi> Eſa. 11. and 66. John 11.</p>
                  <p>5. After that great Apoſtaſie of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Egypt, <hi>The Sonne of God ſtirred up</hi> Moſes, <hi>a faithfull ſervant in his houſe, to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of the Church, and a Teacher to all</hi> Iſrael <hi>fourty years:</hi> And to all the Iſrael of God ever after <hi>Moſes</hi> from Chriſt, directed that <hi>Levites</hi> from twentie five to thirty yeers of age, ſhould be as Graduates, before they entred into the work of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle<hi>:</hi> And they were fourty yeers ſtudying the Law in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. And <hi>Moſes Aaron,</hi> and the ſeventy <hi>Elders,</hi> &amp;c. were famous <hi>Rectors</hi> and <hi>Directors</hi> to them. And in <hi>Davids</hi> dayes, <hi>The Levites had a lower degree to begin to ſtudy and prepare themſelves from twentieyeers old.</hi> Numbers 8. 24. 1 Chron. 23. 24.</p>
                  <p>6. Schools of learning were of great eſteem, even in the dayes of Apoſtaſie, <hi>when the ten Tribes worſhipped the Calves of</hi> Dan <hi>and</hi> Bethel<hi>:</hi> And though <hi>Iezabel</hi> deſtroyed many Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Schools, yet they had ſome godly friends in thoſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting times that preſerved many of them. Good <hi>Obadiah hid one hundred of the Prophets by fiftie in each Cave.</hi> 1 King 18. 4. with 1 King 19. 10. 14.</p>
                  <p>A while after, the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> erected many Prophetical
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:118698:47"/>
Schools in ſundery parts of the tenne Tribes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>He kept a Prophets School at Gilgal.</hi> 2 Kings, 2. 1. with Chap. 4. 38. And in this one School there were one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Scholars, for whoſe ſake <hi>Eliſha healed the bitter pottage:</hi> This Miracle Chriſt did among them for the countenancing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of Schools.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There was another School of the Prophets <hi>at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico.</hi> 2 Kings, 2. 4, 5. and for their comfort and encouragement, <hi>Eliſha healed the barren waters of that place.</hi> verſe 18.</p>
                  <p>3. There was another Prophetical School <hi>at Bethel.</hi> 2 Kings 2. 23. But ſome of the young children of this place <hi>mocked the Prophet Eliſha contumeliouſly,</hi> but for that preſumptuous ſinne, <hi>Eliſha did curſe them;</hi> thereupon fourty two of them were by Gods hand killed with two Bears that came ſuddenly out of the wilderneſs upon them: to the terror of all ungodly-educated chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. <hi>verſe</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>4. Another Prophetical School was <hi>at Carmel,</hi> 2 King. 2. 25. with Chap. 4. 25. &amp; 23.</p>
                  <p>5. Another Prophetical School was <hi>in Samaria</hi> (as I think) for there <hi>Eliſha</hi> did ſometime dwell. 2 Kings 2. 25. and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 5. 3.</p>
                  <p>6 There was another Prophetical School <hi>at Mount Ephraim,</hi> as <hi>Gehazi</hi> tells u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 2 King 5. 22. And we may well conceive that there were many Prophetical Schools in the other parts of the ten Tribes.</p>
                  <p>But what number of Prophetical Scholes were erected in the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> at this time, is not recorded: yet we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that there were moe then in the ten Tribes; becauſe they had ſome Godly Kings that would cheriſh and nouriſh ſuch Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of Learning and Piety. There was a Colledge in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> where <hi>Huldah</hi> the Propheteſſe lived, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 14. It ſeems by the ſtory, that he did not onely live neer unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Scholes, but ſhe was a lover thereof in the affections of her ſoul; and therefore the bleſſing of the Prophets Schole fell upon her, and ſo ſhe became an extraordinary Propheteſſe. Yea, the moſt of the Prophets (as I conceive) were at the firſt trained up in Scholes of Learning, in a way fit for Propheſie, when ever it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to act upon them by his ſpirit immediately: but in caſe the holy ſpirit did come downe upon them, yet they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:118698:47"/>
loſt nothing by their learned pains; for thereby they were made fit to be called into publick places.</p>
                  <p>7. Godly <hi>Daniel, Ananias, Azarias</hi> and <hi>Miſael,</hi> did erect Scholes of Learning among the Jews, that were captived into <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> into <hi>Perſia,</hi> &amp;c. after they were raiſed to places of Honour by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Darius:</hi> elſe how could <hi>Ezra</hi> have been ſo ready and ſo perfect a Scribe in the Law of God, ſhortly after the firſt company that returned out of captivity.</p>
                  <p>8. After the captivitie, this perfect Scribe, <hi>Ezra</hi> together with ſome other Godly Doctors of his Age and time, did erect Scholes of learning, for the preſervation of the Hebrew text, leſt it ſhould be corrupted through the decay of the Hebrew Tongue<hi>:</hi> for they ſaw the Hebrew Tongue began to decay from common uſe; therefore they which the diligence of ten thouſand eyes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and ordained many precious rules for the preſervation of the holy Text, to every Hebrew letter and voice; ſo that no one let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could be loſt, but it might be ſoon eſpied by the obſervation of the ſaid rules. By their rules, and the ſeventy Tranſlation, and by the <hi>Talmudiques,</hi> and by the New Teſtament, the Text and ſenſe of the Old Teſtament is moſt fully preſerved to us, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Hebrew Grammarians which ſprang from <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezra</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of his Age, did with great diligence deviſe many precious rules, to preſerve the purity of the Hebrew text to every letter.</note> continued long after, were called <hi>Maſſorites,</hi> and they were raiſed up by the ſpecial eye of Gods providence, to deviſe certaine rules for the preſervation of the purity of the Hebrew Text, ſo that by their <hi>Orthographie Dictionary</hi> or <hi>Maſſoreth,</hi> the Hebrew that is kept moſt pure and perfect, ſo that no one letter was ever more or leſſe; nor of any other forme in <hi>Moſes</hi> time, with <hi>Vowels, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,</hi> and <hi>Marginal-readings</hi> (expounding the Text,) then at this day. <hi>vid.</hi> Mr <hi>Broughton, Apoc.</hi> 65. and in <hi>pag.</hi> 118. he ſaith, <hi>that the Maſſorites Dictionary was invented for the peeſervation of every Letter, Prick, and Accent.</hi> And a latter work called <hi>Tipheroth Iſrael</hi> tells us, That <hi>the Hebrew Letters, Pricks, and Accents, are at this day as God ſet them in the two Tables. vid.</hi> Mr <hi>Brought.</hi> in <hi>Apoc.</hi> 294.</p>
                  <p>9. This great diligence of theſe Godly Schole-Doctors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be had in everlaſting remembrance, and their good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ought to be imitated of all Governors of Scholes of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Some praiſe is due to them that erect fair buildings, for

Scholes of learning; But more praiſe is due to them that ſtudy to ſet up the beſt way of Diſcipline that can be deviſed, for the train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of young Students in the ſpeedy underſtanding of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Tongues, and in the right underſtanding of the true ſenſe of the text.</p>
                  <p>Let me produce one Rule which the Hebrew Doctors deviſed, for the preſervation of the Holy Text, touching the latter <hi>Jod:</hi> they would not have the letter <hi>Iod</hi> to periſh from the Law, and therefore by way of <hi>Proſopopeia,</hi> they bring in the Law as a Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife before God, complaining of loſing <hi>Iod,</hi> with humble cry before God, in theſe words. <hi>O Lord of the world, this is thy rule, that a Teſtament which faileth in a Letter, faileth in all: in</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rai <hi>I had</hi> Jod, <hi>but when ſhe was named</hi> Sarah, <hi>then</hi> Jod <hi>was gone, and ſo the authoritie of the Law is loſt.</hi> God anſwereth thus, <hi>Thou haſt no loſſe at all; for though</hi> Jod <hi>was in the end of a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine, yet now I have ſet it in the beginning of a maſculine, when I named</hi> Hoſhea <hi>by the name</hi> Jehoſhuah. <hi>uid.</hi> M. <hi>Broughton,</hi> in <hi>Apoc.</hi> 297.</p>
                  <p>Alſo he further ſheweth, that <hi>this diligence of the</hi> Maſſorites <hi>for the preſervation of the leaſt Letter, our Lord commendeth, in theſe two words,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 18. by theſe two terms our Lord doth tell us, that <hi>the leaſt Letter or Tittle in the Law ſhall not faile:</hi> but any man may ſee that he borroweth this ſpeech from the <hi>Maſſorites</hi> diligence, touching the Letter <hi>Iod.</hi> And by theſe termes our Lord doth countenance Gramer-ſtudy, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable proffeſſion, by naming the leaſt letter in the Greek tongue, in his book: for the terme <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is rare; none of the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hen have it (that I remember) but <hi>Plutarch:</hi> yet <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> have it. Hence we may learne, that though <hi>Punctum</hi> (a <hi>prick)</hi> hath no quantitie, yet the terme is of great quantitie. <hi>Bro.</hi> on <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>10. Again, There fifteen words in the Old Teſtament that are pricked over the head, for ſpecial deep conſideration, and they have ever been ſo written from the firſt Copie. The Hebrew Doctors call theſe Pricks <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> But that terme is not uſed by <hi>Matthew,</hi> nor by the <hi>Syriack</hi> or <hi>Arabick:</hi> therefore not the fifteen ſtrange Pricks, but Vowel Pricks muſt needs be meant, which point containeth the moſt exquiſite depth of the Hebrew Tongue. And thus our Lord doth approve and commend our

Schole-ſtuddies, by touching upon theſe terms<hi>:</hi> and by this his teſtimony he authorizeth all the reſt. <hi>vide</hi> Maſter <hi>Broughton</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. in his Reduction of the Goſpel to <hi>Gabriels</hi> Relation.</p>
                  <p>Again, The Hebrew Doctors of <hi>Ezraes</hi> Age, gave another rule for the preſervation of the Hebrew text. They reckon how often every letter cometh in the Hebrew text, how often words of ſhort or full writing were diverſly written, and where, and what ſtrange text would ſeem corruptions to the unſtayed: and how often <hi>eth</hi> and <hi>vau,</hi> (little particles) do come together, in ſort eaſie to deceive a Coppyer, without a Table of Direction. Such points are a Brazen wall to keep the Scriptures certainty. <hi>vid.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bro.</hi> in <hi>Epiſt. to the Nobil. p.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>From this provident care of God over the Hebrew text, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that neither book nor letter of the Hebrew text, which was written by Gods Prophets, for the uſe of all ages is loſt<hi>:</hi> onely thoſe books are loſt which ſome Prophets wrote in the nature of humane Chronicles, for the preſent uſe of that Age and Nation: and in that reſpect they took no more care to preſerve them, then they did of their humane Chronicles, becauſe they did nothing at all concerne other Nations in after Ages. But every book and letter which the Prophets wrote as Divine Scripture, for the uſe of all Nations and Ages, Jeſus Chriſt hath preſerved by the diligence of the <hi>Maſſorites.</hi> And their Tables of Direction are extant and kept ſafe with great care until this day<hi>:</hi> one of thoſe Tables is kept <hi>Naharden</hi> upon <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and another is kept at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, the Hebrew Doctors from and after <hi>Ezra</hi> took ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <note place="margin">The Hebrew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors took care for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth of doctrine, as well as for the preſervation of the Hebrew Text.</note> care to preſerve the truth of Doctrine unto Poſterity: and for this end they made the <hi>ten Commandments</hi> to be the foundation of every point of Doctrine. And our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, that the <hi>whole Law and the Prophets doth hang upon the two Tables.</hi> Matth. 22. 40. Therefore the ten Commandments muſt needs contain in them all matters concerning faith and manners<hi>:</hi> and therefore the ancient Hebrew Doctors might well make the ten Commandments the foundation of every point of Doctrine. And for the honour of the two Tables, they did number up all the letters of the two Tables, and found them to be ſix hundred and thirteen, then they drew up all the Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> unto ſix hundred and thirteen. They might have made them mo, or fewer; but by Gods ſpirit in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118698:49"/>
of the two Tables, they bring them juſt to the number of ſix hundred and thirteen<hi>:</hi> they make two hundred forty and eight bidding Commandments, telling us what we ſhould believe or do; and 365. forbidding evil. <hi>vid. M. Brought.</hi> in <hi>Apoc.</hi> 175.</p>
                  <p>But after the Hebrew Doctors, under this ſilver age of the Perſian Monarchy were decayed, then the Jews began to be more looſe in Religion under the iron Dominion of the <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae</hi> and <hi>Lagidae.</hi> The cruel wars of thoſe daies bred ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanes among the generality of the Jews, eſpecially under the reign of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> that many Jews became Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical Sadduces<hi>:</hi> yet then in theſe evil daies, God by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence raiſed up ſome Schools of Learning, wherein were ſome godly Doctors that took care to preſerve the truth of Doctrine, in oppoſition to thoſe Atheiſtical Sadduces<hi>:</hi> And this they did by enacting divers terms of Religion. They called all the Books of the Old Teſtament, <hi>The Law,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sadduces did now reject all the Books of the Old Teſtament, except the five Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo enacted divers termes wherein they profeſſed the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoul, in oppoſition to the ſaid Sadduces; as I have formerly noted it before at large.</p>
                  <p>After thoſe daies, they had ſtill ſome care of godly learning: for in the daies of our Saviour, they did maintain Schools of Learning, and our Lord was preſent among the Doctors, <hi>hearing them, and poſing them with Queſtions.</hi> Luke 2. 46. And <hi>in Jeruſalem there were certain of the Synagogue, called</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bartines, <hi>which roſe in oppoſition to</hi> Stephens <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Acts 6. 9. Theſe <hi>Lubartines</hi> muſt not be taken for <hi>Libertines,</hi> as ſome unadviſedly do call them, becauſe of their oppoſition to <hi>Stephen,</hi> but that is a great miſtake: I ſay they were called <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bartines,</hi> becauſe they belonged to ſome <hi>Lubar</hi> or <hi>Colledge: Lubar</hi> ſaith <hi>M.

                     </gap>, and on ſuch high pieces of ground they uſed to build their Schools.</p>
                  <p>Again, in another of theſe Schools <hi>Paul was brought up at the ſeet of</hi> Gamaliel: <hi>and there he was taught according to the perfect manner of the Law of the Fathers.</hi> Acts 22.</p>
                  <p>Again, many ſuch Schools were erected am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:118698:49"/>
Schools was governed by one <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> and <hi>there the Diſciples diſputed daily. Acts</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> by the means of theſe Schools, hath in all ages nurſed up many godly and able ſcholars, fit to teach the Law in ſynagogues, and fit to bear Office as Elders, in the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> Courts.</p>
                  <p>And theſe Schools of Learning were ſo highly ſet by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews in ancient time <hi>(neoterici noſtrates effuciunt)</hi> that they accounted it a great ſhame for any man of wealth or leiſure, if they did not frequent thoſe Schools at the leaſt three times a week, except hand-labourers. <hi>Maymony</hi> in <hi>Thal. Thora,</hi> ſaith; <hi>That all the Jews but hand-labourers did bring up their children from ſeven yeers old to fourteen, in learning the plain tongue: yea, they ſtudied the Tongue all their daies week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for ſome few hours; not minding gains thereby, but delight to know God:</hi> And our Saviour at <hi>twelvs yeers of Age delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſit in the midſt of the Doctors, hearing them, poſing them, and asking them Queſtions: and all that heard him were aſtonied at his underſtanding and anſwers.</hi> Luke 2. 46, 47.

                  <p>Yea, the Jews ſet a higher eſteem upon their Schools of Learning, then they did upon their Synagogues. <hi>vid. Ainſw.</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 31. and ſuch priviledges did belong to Schools of learning, as rewards of learning<hi>:</hi> that if a Scholar at unawares committed man-ſlaughter, and thereupon was exiled to a Citie of Refuge, his maſter muſt go with him, as it is written, <hi>[and live]</hi> For the life of them that love and ſeek after Wiſdom, is counted as death without the Doctrine of the Law.
